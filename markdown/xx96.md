####Skyline Complex,
Queenstown, New Zealand
####Features:
Table Top Booth
1 Language English => Japanese
20 Receivers

**Date:**

####July 2010
####Notes:
Fantastic Location!
Logistically difficult, since all the equipment was taken up by Gondola from the Base of the Mountain, up to Skyline complex.
One of our table top booths was perfect for the job, since it fitted on the Gondola and the event ran for a short time.
