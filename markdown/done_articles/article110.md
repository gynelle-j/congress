## Notes:

 - Congress Rental Network provided Conference Microphones and Simultaneous Interpretation for APEC Leaders in Singapore.

Originally planning to provide equipment for ASEAN-US Dialogue conference with leaders from ASEAN along with US President Obama with 12 Microphones, 4 booths for languages ( Lao, Myanmar, Vietnam, Korea) and 80 Digital Infra-red receivers for senior government support staff. It came as quite a shock when 24 hours before the day of the event the requirement for 5 additional booths were required. Azhar Zainal, the operations manager of Congress Rental in Singapore said, &ldquo;we are used to these very tight time frames for making decisions (24 hours notice), but the security to get the booths out of one venue and into the Shangri-la where the event was held was amazing, I have never seen anything like it.&rdquo;

The event from a technical perspective went off seamlessly and everybody was happy.

We, along with the Mexican Interpreter also got a personal wave from President Obama.
