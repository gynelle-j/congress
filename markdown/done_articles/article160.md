Silent Auction Detail
=====================

Using the wireless devices, guests can simply insert their smart cards and enter their bids into their keypad and the LCD screen instantly informs them if their bid has been successful. Guests have more time to socialise as they can submit their bids without leaving their group conversation.

The bids are recorded instantly, thereby creating an immediate sense on how well the fundraising is going. There is no need to walk around and look at bid sheets; the progress can be monitored through the streaming updates from the system.


## Reports
The reports are generated within minutes of the close of the auction, where multiple lots won and pledges made by each individual guest are grouped together with a ‘checkout’ total.
