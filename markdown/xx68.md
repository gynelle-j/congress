 After the dinner, the room is turned around into classroom style and the microphones are laid out. So that on the Saturday, the plenary runs all day, using the microphones.
 On the Sunday morning the 4x Breakout rooms are used, each with about 30x microphones.
 In each of the rooms there are 2x Dome cameras and these automatically move to the person speaking, so that they can be seen on plasma screens located in the room.
