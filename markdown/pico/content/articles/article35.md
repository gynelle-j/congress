Whatever your conference requirements, the Bosch DCN Next Generation can meet them. By bringing aesthetic appeal, reliability, flexibility and control into the proceedings. It helps you take the next step in congress system management. To create the right balance between ergonomic efficiency and aesthetic appeal, our designers consulted delegates, interpreters and operators,

and responded to their recommendations. The result is optimum satisfaction for everyone in the congress chain. With the Bosch DCN Next Generation, you can relax. Your meeting is in good hands.

**Innovation in digital congress management**

The Bosch DCN has already earned global recognition for its versatility, and DCN Next Generation continues the tradition. It is ideal for applications ranging from discussion groups up to multi-lingual congresses with thousands. On its most straight forward level, it handles speaking and listening without an operator; at its most advanced, it becomes an integrated communication infrastructure for facilitating and managing even the most complex international conferences. With Bosch DCN Next Generation, you benefit from years of expertise in congress systems. You have the reassurance of a reliable, established partner. And you can count on a support network that spans the globe.

When you think congress, think Bosch.

**System design**

[ ![381_finalrender](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09 /381_finalrender-300x240.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/381_finalrender.jpg)

The DCN Next Generation System is designed to be extraordinarily flexible. Your system can be as small or large as required, with extra units simply plugged into existing ones in a ‘loop-through’ configuration. There is also an extremely high level of compatibility with external systems.

**Aesthetic design**

[ ![NG Microphone Choices](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/NG-Microphone-Choices- 300x215.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/NG- Microphone-Choices.jpg)

Design plays a key role in how people interact with each other; it is important to create an environment that encourages constructive dialog. The DCN Next Generation offers a perfect mix of sophisticated looks and optimized performance. The layout of the sleek control panel has an instantly familiar feel. And the application of advanced acoustical and display technology makes it easy to hear and read exactly what’s going on. All of this puts users at ease, and in control.

**Concentus Table Top Units**

[ ![LBB 4145_00_2](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09 /LBB-4145_00_2-300x200.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LBB-4145_00_2.jpg)

All delegate and chairman units feature the innovative flat panel loudspeaker that improves acoustic performance (up to 20 kHz) and reduces feedback, resulting in outstanding speech intelligibility. Certain models also offer language channel selectors, ID card readers and a backlit graphical LCD screen that displays all standard Windows characters – including complex European languages and

icon-based scripts like Chinese and Japanese.

**Simultaneous Interpretation**

[ ![Interpreter &amp; Desk copy](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Interpreter-Desk-copy- 300x238.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09 /Interpreter-Desk-copy.jpg)

Hi-Fi quality interpretation channels, With up to 32 language channels, the DCN Next Generation easily handles the most demanding requirements of the international congress world. Delegates may choose the floor language or any of 31 interpretations, all delivered with true Hi-Fi sound quality.

The ergonomically designed interpreter desk is a powerful, intuitive tool for interpreters. Suitable either as a table top unit or flush-mounted into a desk. It was designed after exhaustive research on how to make the interpreter’s task easier and less tiring. It is especially useful for blind users, through the logical positioning of buttons and the possibility of audible feedback. Greater interpreter satisfaction leads to higher quality, enhancing the reputation of your venue.

The desk is simply plugged into the system cabling (where it is automatically recognized), powered up, and is ready for use. This means you can easily vary the number of interpreted languages required in each room of a multi-room venue on a daily basis. Additional interpreter desks are simply added to supply extra language capacity.

An important aspect to multi-lingual conferencing is the language distribution system. DCN Next

Generation delegate positions can easily be equipped with wired, flush-mounted channel selector panels. This allows the selection of any interpretations or the floor language.

For wireless convenience, Bosch also offers the Integrus, a digital infrared language distribution system that is immune to interference from lighting systems and bright sunlight. It produces crystal-clear sound due a very high signal-to-noise ratio plus built-in error correction.

Interpreted languages are distributed to the pocket-sized receivers via infrared, giving conference delegates complete freedom of movement while listening to the chosen language interpretation on headphones. In addition, infrared transmission increases privacy, as signals do not pass through walls or ceilings.

The full potential of the DCN Next Generation is realized with PC control. A family of dedicated DCN software modules deals with all aspects of conference management and control. This increases the system’s functionality while simplifying operation. Control can be via a single PC, or distributed over several PC’s to facilitate monitoring or task delegation. Pre-conference activities – like encoding delegate ID cards and writing voting scripts – are also easier.

**Extended voting and registration functionality**

**Versatile voting**

[ ![LBB4142-00 with capsCC](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LBB4142-00-with-capsCC- 300x109.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LBB4142-00-with-capsCC.jpg)

The DCN Next Generation incorporates standard parliamentary-style voting facilities. Using dedicated application software, the possibilities can be extended to include audience response, multiple choice and rating voting. Scripts are prepared in advance, allowing results to be instantly

displayed on a video monitor or dedicated text display in the conference venue. The chairman or operator always has full control over starting, stopping and suspending voting.

**Delegate registration and identification**

[ ![Delegate registration and identification](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSCF0074_J-300x200.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSCF0074_J.jpg)

Conference participants can register their presence by inserting an ID card into a card reader that is flush-mounted, integrated into the Concentus unit, or located at the conference venue entrance. A push button on delegate units allows simple registration (without identification). It is also possible to specify that delegates may only make use of certain microphone or control functions if they possess an appropriate ID card or have entered an authorized PIN code.

**Audio expansion**

Audio logging, remote interpretation, transporting or distributing audio from one room to another room is possible over relatively long distances without loss via fibre optic cabling, by using audio

expanders (analogue or digital) which are part of DCN Next Generation. There is a growing desire to build audio systems where signal processing and amplification components are distributed through-

out a facility. Therefore DCN Next Generation interfaces easily with CobraNet&trade;,which is the industry’s leading technology for distributing uncompressed real-time digital audio over a Fast ethernet network.

**Camera control - an extra dimension in conference systems**

[ ![Dome Camera Integration](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dome-Camera-Integration- 300x196.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dome- Camera-Integration.jpg)

A visual dimension not only generates interest and focuses attention, but also informs participants and observers (such as the press) who is speaking. The DCN Next Generation can automatically show an image of the current speaker on monitors or projection screens in the main hall, lobby, interpreters booths, breakout rooms or anywhere else required. The speaker’s name and additional information can also appear on screen. Camera control is automatic, so no constant operator attention is required. Bosch AutoDome® cameras are ideal for this application.
