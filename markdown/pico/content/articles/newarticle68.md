Congress Rental has a unique mechanism that allows a Video Dome Camera to automatically track to any microphone that is turned on, to focus on the delegate and provide a video feed output of that delegate without any user intervention.

The video dome camera integrates with the conference microphones. The video dome system can be integrated with a videoconferencing system to offer a far superior performance compared to a standard videoconferencing option. Imagine being able to do videoconferencing for 100+ people.

The system can manage an unlimited number of video dome cameras and automatically have those video dome cameras with software control automatically track to any &ldquo;live&rdquo; conference microphones at the event.

Congress Rental has developed this technology so that the video dome cameras sit on pedestals that have been optimized in height. The video dome cameras can also be hung from trusses should they be required.

Applications for this dome camera integration with microphones include: Provision of additional visibility for delegates in a large hollow square configuration. For press rooms, overflow rooms or viewing rooms, where video and audio from the main room need to be seen and heard remotely.

This system integrates standard Bosch dome cameras along with a video switcher &amp; Bosch conference microphones

**Introduction**

[ ![Introduction](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/113.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/113.jpg)

In this example (APEC 2007, Ministers Responsible for Mining meeting) The Dome Video cameras are mounted inside the hollow square and mounted in pedestals to provide an integrated look and feel.

When a Microphone is &ldquo;turned on&ldquo; the dome video camera automatically rotates and locates the &ldquo;Live Microphone&rdquo; using pre-sets in the camera. This is done without any user intervention and is unique to Bosch / Congress Rental.

The audio and video are integrated 100%. Should your meeting be of a sensitive nature or be a high security event then the system will operate without any technician support or intervention,

It takes less that ½ a second to locate and focus on a delegate.

The system can be set to show a wide angle shot of the head table or of the room whilst the camera rotates so that you don’t have to see the camera movement

**Applications**

**Large Rooms**

Where delegates are widely dispersed and a long way from each other, communication can be improved through having the delegate facial expressions shown on a large screen or on Plasma screens placed in front of delegates.

**Video Conferencing**

This system can be seamlessly integrated into a Videoconferencing system. The Congress Rental Videoconferencing solution is particularly useful for Videoconferencing large meetings, where traditional video conferencing solutions fall down. We create a dedicated video source that inputs to the Videoconferencing system and over rides the fixed camera system.

Our Video Tracking Conferencing system eliminates acoustics problems created through widely spaced delegates and annoying background noise. This is achieved by managing limiting the number of open microphones (The more open microphones the more annoying background noise). We also automatically zoom in on the person speaking, providing a guaranteed close up of that person so that their facial expressions are crystal clear.

**Simultaneous Interpretation – Remote Interpreting**

[ ![Simultaneous Interpretation – Remote Interpreting](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/115-249x300.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/115.jpg)

Interpreters providing Simultaneous Interpretation for a meeting should ideally be near the delegates at the meeting, in order to see their expressions and understand the flow and context of the meeting through body language.

In some cases when in a large venue the Interpreters are a long way from the delegates, or when there is a small venue, the Interpreters are located in a separate room. In these situations Congress Rental provides the remote interpretation solution, whereby the speaker is always on screen for the interpreter to see &ldquo;close up&rdquo;.

In addition to the Video Tracking Microphone system which provides the close up of the speaker, we can also provide a wide screen shot of the room so the Interpreters can see the overall dynamics of the room and another separate feed of the PowerPoint presentations.

These support video technologies greatly enhance the service to the Interpreters and therefore the quality of the Interpretation.

**Media Rooms**

In cases where the media are excluded from the main Plenary, for security or other reasons, they can be accommodated in a separate room. The media monitoring of the meeting can then occur without the media entering the room.
