Congress is the leading and largest provider of simultaneous interpretation equipment and conference microphones in Australia. We also have offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane / Gold Coast and Operate throughout New Zealand and the Pacific Region. Our Sister company Congress Rental Pte Ltd is based in Singapore and operates throughout Asia.

Our Simultaneous Interpretation equipment, also known sometimes as Simultaneous Translation, Translation equipment or Simtran Equipment is Bosch equipment and is the best available. Our Simultaneous Interpretation Rental equipment stock is mostly under 2 years old and our aim is to continually replace the equipment so that customers get the best Interpretation equipment available.

**Booths**

Our booths are the only ones in Australia that are truly ISO4043 compliant. Our soundproof certification testing shows that they are truly soundproof. These booths are always supplied with fans in the roof that provide the required amount of air circulation. Interpreters love our sound proof booths!

Check that all your possible suppliers have soundproof certification. Download our Booth Specifications. Some suppliers have a hole in the roof and call it ventilation! Ask for photos. Other suppliers have gaps in the side of their booths, that are part of the construction process. Ask us for a demo or see our equipment in use and see the difference.

Our Booth external Dimensions are 1720mm (W) x 1720mm (D) x 2280mm (H)

Our receivers are Truly Digital. This ensures that they are Interference free 100% guaranteed! We can guarantee that we will be able to use each channel from Channel 1 through to Channel 32 Consecutively and without noise. If your supplier does not have Bosch Integrus Digital Receivers they can’t make the same promise.

We previously had Analogue technology and know its susceptible to lighting and other ambient noise sources. So we know the pitfalls and problems. If you are comparing us with a cheaper price then ask us for an analogue solution.

**Our Radiators**

[ ![Radiators](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2-300x233.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2.jpg)

Our Radiators are 25Watts. This means that you get the largest coverage with the least number of radiators. We guarantee the coverage, as we carefully calculate the number of radiators required based on the number of channels and area to be covered.

**Our People**

[ ![Certificate](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/3-210x300.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/3.jpg)

Congress Rental technicians are qualified either directly by Bosch or through a rigorous internal training program.

Full system checks are undertaken prior to all events. The equipment is then re-checked each day prior to the start of the day’s event. Technicians are always available on site at least 1 hour prior to the commencement of the event and earlier on the first day.

Our technicians are trained to problem solve and resolve issues, should they occur. They pay particular attention to ensuring that all cabling is discreet or hidden, and to ensure there are no safety hazards created.

Our technicians constantly monitor the interpreter’s input and output to ensure that any issues are rectified immediately, often before delegates know that a problem exists.

**Simultaneous Interpretation Equipment – A complete solution**

Congress Rental makes the process of adding Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) to a conference or meeting straight forward.

Our liaison with your designated venue is seamless as we have previously installed in most venues. We interface with your audio visual company and we manage all areas of service – bump in, installation, operation and bump out – in consultation with you, and without the need for supervision. We also manage the freight including duties, customs, carnet’s and local delivery.
