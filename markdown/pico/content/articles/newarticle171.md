Audience response has never been so simple! This solution does away with expensive and cumbersome proprietary audience response hardware - utilising accessible and commonly available standard mobile phone and web technology instead.

This is by far the easiest way to gather live responses in any setting: conferences, presentations, classrooms, radio, television and more. It works internationally with Texting, Web, or Twitter earning rave reviews for its simplicity and flexibility
