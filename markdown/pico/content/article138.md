**Notes:**

This event is challenging because the Gala Dinner format needs to be changed to Classroom style overnight.

Software manages the microphones so that Microphones accidentally left on by delegates can be turned off by the operator. Having this software also tells the operator if any cables are kicked out accidentally, or disconnected (Before even delegates know there is a problem)
