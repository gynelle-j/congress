**Location:**

####Sheraton Hotel - Singapore
####Features:
30 Communicators
250 Pre-programmed Smart Cards

**Date:**

####August 2009
####Notes:
Silent Auctions enable electronic bidding for items, thereby massively increasing the number of bids and therefore the income for Silent auction organisers.
Lots, their value and Photo are pre-programmed into the system. Smart cards are pre-programmed with the attendeeâ€™s name.
This was the first ever use of our technology in Singapore for a Silent Auction event and it was a great success raising over SGD $35,000.
