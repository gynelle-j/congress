DCN uses only a <strong>single cable</strong> to carry all the system's digital signals, installation is easy and economical. By simply <strong>daisy-chaining</strong> the modular DCN units, any configuration can be put together quickly and easily. DCN technology also allows modules to be easily inserted at any point in the system cabling, so systems can be easily expanded to meet changing requirements. <strong>Software control and PC control are also possible. Small configurations do not require an operator, and even complex configurations can be monitored by a single operator.
