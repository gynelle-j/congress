**Quick set-up**

Designed to be the most flexible discussion system available, the Bosch DCN Wireless Conference Microphone Discussion System offers the perfect solution for challenging locations such as multiuser venues and historical buildings. For multi-use venues, the wireless system allows owners to service customers better, easily and more effectively. With minimal time required for set-up or break-down, multiple events can take place in sequence, meaning better and more effective use of space.

**No impact on location**

For historical locations, the benefits can be even more pronounced. A discussion system can be installed, rearranged and operated with virtually no impact on the integrity of the historical location. One no longer has to worry about damaging antique materials or ruining the aesthetics of a grand hall. No cables have to be laid or holes drilled. The entire system has been designed to be beautiful and unobtrusive so that all participants can focus on the event at hand.

**The WAP**

With the User in Mind

**Easily adaptable**

The DCN Wireless Conference Microphone Discussion System has been intelligently designed to be as user friendly as possible, whether the user is a system operator, chairman or participant. Discussion units are comfortable and intuitive to use. The system is built with high end finishing materials, giving it a timeless and discrete look. The design includes changeable rims (charcoal black, mat or glossy metal and silver), meaning that you can modify each discussion unit to better fit with its environment.

** Single access point **

The award-winning Wireless Access Point (WAP) provides a consistently strong connection for a range of approximately 30m (100ft). The WAP can be positioned centrally for optimal coverage or easily moved to the most convenient and discreet location in the room.

**Feeling secure**

The system is protected against interference from mobile phones and other equipment making use of WiFi, Blue-Tooth or microwave signals. A proprietary protocol protects against 3 rd party eaves dropping.

**No interruptions **

Battery functionality has been designed with simplicity and effectiveness in mind. The system features high capacity and easily removable chargeable battery packs, as well as a dynamic overview of battery consumption. To conserve power consumption during longer breaks, each unit is capable of a patent-pending &ldquo;sleep mode&rdquo;. Conferences need never again be interrupted because of low battery power.

**Simple Standalone or Control Software**

**Simple, yet scalable**

Never has a wireless conference microphone discussion system been so easy to use, yet so powerful. For a simple set-up the system is almost ready to use right out of the box. But for more demanding situations, the range of functionality and additional options are impressive.

The congress control software allows an operator a great degree of control over the system. Delegate names can be easily assigned to all wireless discussion units before a meeting. The operator has control over the microphones during the meeting; he can start or stop voting sessions and display and log the voting results.During the conference, an operator can also monitor the battery status of every individual wireless discussion unit, and check whether or not all the units are receiving the signal properly. The software is optimized for touch screens and features a multi-lingual graphical user interface (GUI).
