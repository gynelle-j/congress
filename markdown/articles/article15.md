 - Every member of your audience is given a voting handset.   
 - Questions are displayed to the audience   
 - Participants select their answer   
 - The vote is closed and the results are instantly displayed

At Congress Rental, we provide wireless audience response systems that transmit data from the keypads to the base station via Radio Frequency (2.4 GHz WIFI). This ensures that we can cater to both small and large groups on a single base station. The data travels via Radio Frequency, therefore participants merely need to be within range of the base station, and need not maintain line-of-sight between keypads and the receiver.

A producer will be on-site to operate the chosen audience response solution.

At the end of the event, detailed voting results will be provided for client to perform further analysis.

## What do delegates using Audience Response Systems say?

&ldquo;When I was given the handset, I felt that my opinion was being valued.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It feels powerful as I am able to influence and help shape the outcomes of the conference.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It helps us, the participants, to focus on the results voted on when we are having a discussion&rdquo;

## What do organisers who use Audience Response Systems say?

&ldquo;It is more interesting for the audience as they are able to see how the votes go.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Rather than just talking, the polling results are the evidence of the discussion and group opinion.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Results of the votes are useful information for tracking and analysis after the event.&ldquo; 

&ldquo;I saved days of effort in compiling the evaluation forms. I was able to provide it to the client as soon as the event ended and it was all done. Fantastic!&rdquo;
