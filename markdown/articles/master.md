Our IML Voting Communicator, IML Audience Response, IML Polling &amp; IML Text interactive devices have proven software for a diverse range of events.

![OCBC bank](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case__OCBC_3.jpg)

This reliable and unique state of the art technology audience response system offers presenters, auctioneers, organisers and hosts of any event or conference the ability to interact with their audience easily. Whether it is an electronic voting system in a conference or a silent auction taking place at a fundraising event, audience participation is essential and this is where an audience response system can make a big difference.

![OCBC bank](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case__OCBC_2.jpg)

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> I was pleased with the professional services and responsiveness from Congress Rental. Their producer, Joan, guided us on how we could use the system right from the preparation stage. On both days of the event, they arrived ahead of schedule and set-up and integrated their audience response system seamlessly with our appointed AV vendor. The event went smoothly and I would recommend them to anyone who is planning to use audience response system for an event.

Audience participation is an incredibly important aspect of any successful event. However this can become tricky to manage and encourage when an audience grows past a certain size, this is where an audience response system comes in very useful.

**THE CLIENT**

![OCBC bank](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case__OCBC_1.jpg)

![OCBC bank](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case__OCBC_2.jpg)

OCBC Bank is one of Asia’s leading financial services groups and one of the largest financial institutions in the combined Singapore-Malaysia market. OCBC Bank is among the world’s highest rated banks.

In January 2011, 800 customers attended an investment seminar hosted by OCBC Premier Banking covering equity, foreign exchange and property markets.

**THE CHALLENGE**

The client contacted Congress Rental in their search for professional audience response services to enable the audience to participate in live polling. To create a dialogue between the seminar speakers, the client wanted to enable live polling so that they can also gauge customer sentiments on equity, currency and property markets.

The client was hosting two seminars, one in Mandarin and one in English, which meant that **bilingual voting slides** were required for the Mandarin seminar. The organisers wanted flexibility to make amendments to the polling questions, catering for **last minute changes from the speakers** up to the point of the rehearsal.

**ACTIONS**

Congress Rental provided 480 and 320 Communicators respectively, for each run of the seminars conducted in English and Chinese, during which OCBC Premier Banking customers were polled on their views on market sentiments.

From the pre-sales stage, a producer was assigned to this project to provide seamless support throughout. Upon understanding the client’s requirements, the committee members were given a run-through of the proposed polling slides, presentation of the results and the countdown timer music. Further amendments requested for by the team were drafted, simulated within the Congress Rental system and then transmitted for review by the client. This gave the client the assurance and confidence that the outcome would match expectations.

**RESULTS**

![OCBC bank](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case__OCBC_3.jpg)

The setup and the testing of the system went smoothly within the short timeframe. The producer was on hand to assist the Master of Ceremony and the speakers to familiarize the technology. Even though there were last minute changes and clarification from the organizing committee, these were easily incorporated into the audience response system.

The interactivity provided by the Communicator handsets meant that attendees were engaged throughout the various topics while encouraging active participation. The voting process was easy to administer and the participants were able to use the devices with ease. There was a lively atmosphere, as the Premier Banking customers were able to give their valued views on market sentiments for equity, foreign exchange and property markets. The speakers were impressed by the proficient insight given by the clientele.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> I was pleased with the professional services and responsiveness from Congress Rental. Their producer, Joan, guided us on how we could use the system right from the preparation stage. On both days of the event, they arrived ahead of schedule and set-up and integrated their audience response system seamlessly with our appointed AV vendor. The event went smoothly and I would recommend them to anyone who is planning to use audience response system for an event.

**THE CLIENT**

[image](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case__Swiss_4.jpg)

Swiss Reinsurance, headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland, is the only reinsurer with a client-centric model with teams built around their clients on a global basis.With a strong reputation in innovative reinsurance and risk management solutions, Swiss Reinsurance is committed to engage with the world to find more robust solutions to common perils.

For its flag ship Asia Claims Conference in 2010, they wanted to differentiate this conference for their clients as well as business associates.

**THE CHALLENGE**

Instead of JUST talking to their participants throughout the two-day meeting, the organisers wanted to have an interactive conference where the audience is included as part of the event. When the organizing committee first went in search of the audience response solution on the internet, they had never heard of this technology.

In order to gather inputs to make improvements for the next meeting, the team wanted to receive feedback from the audience. A tradition paper-based evaluation form was thought to be too time consuming and painstaking to compile.

**ACTIONS**

To make the event more interactive, lively and productive, Swiss Reinsurance engaged Congress Rental to provide an audience response system.

The audience response system was ideal for Asian audience as it kept the audience engaged throughout the conference while building rapport between them and the various speakers. The participants were polled on various issues ranging from their concerns about the current global economic situation on the insurance market to their thoughts on claims related issues on specific industry sectors at appropriate intervals during the conference. The speakers were able to gauge the knowledge of the audience which helped them to pace their presentations. Evaluation of the presentations and event were also conducted using the interactive system, making this a greener meeting. The response rates were much higher than anticipated, where about 70% of the audience responded.

**RESULTS**

Swiss Reinsurance was able to harness the benefits of technology to capture information while maximizing feedback during the event. Attendees gave positive feedback on the enhanced interaction as the handsets added an extra dimension to the event. With the reports provided at the end of the event, Swiss Reinsurance was able to gain insights into the results and at the same time use the feedback to help shape their future events.

Audience response systems ensure every member of your audience is involved and actively participating throughout the conference or meeting.

Audience response is a proven method to help increase learning, retain knowledge, build consensus and make decisions. Audience response systems facilitate corporate organizations as well as educational institutions.

           

**Benefits of Using Audience Response Systems**

 - Improve attentiveness and engagement
 - Attain buy-in through the use of the audiences &ldquo;own&rdquo; data
 - Increase knowledge retention
 - Poll anonymously
 - Real-time response
 - Display polling results immediately
 - Create an interactive and fun learning environment
 - Confirm audience understanding of key points immediately
 - Speed up decision making
 - Gather data for reporting and analysis
 - Lower your carbon footprint
 - Track individual responses, where required

**How does it work?**

[ ![Quiz Night](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Quiz- Night-cropped-150ppi-300x201.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Quiz-Night-cropped-150ppi.jpg)

 - Every member of your audience is given a voting handset.   
 - Questions are displayed to the audience   
 - Participants select their answer   
 - The vote is closed and the results are instantly displayed

At Congress Rental, we provide wireless audience response systems that transmit data from the keypads to the base station via Radio Frequency (2.4 GHz WIFI). This ensures that we can cater to both small and large groups on a single base station. The data travels via Radio Frequency, therefore participants merely need to be within range of the base station, and need not maintain line-of-sight between keypads and the receiver.

A producer will be on-site to operate the chosen audience response solution.

At the end of the event, detailed voting results will be provided for client to perform further analysis.

**What do delegates using Audience Response Systems say?**

&ldquo;When I was given the handset, I felt that my opinion was being valued.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It feels powerful as I am able to influence and help shape the outcomes of the conference.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It helps us, the participants, to focus on the results voted on when we are having a discussion&rdquo;

**What do organisers who use Audience Response Systems say?**

&ldquo;It is more interesting for the audience as they are able to see how the votes go.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Rather than just talking, the polling results are the evidence of the discussion and group opinion.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Results of the votes are useful information for tracking and analysis after the event.&ldquo; 

&ldquo;I saved days of effort in compiling the evaluation forms. I was able to provide it to the client as soon as the event ended and it was all done. Fantastic!&rdquo;

Congress Rental provides audience response systems from CLiKAPAD to cater for standard voting requirements. This system is ideal for clients looking for a budget solution.

The entire audience response system consists of light-weight, credit card sized keypads with Radio Frequency transmission (2.4GHz WIFI band) compact base station connected via USB port. The whole system can be easily transported from meeting to meeting as it packs neatly into its own carry case.

This is especially useful for international events where the system can be hand-carried by the producer to the conference, without the hassle of having to organise logistics with freight forwarding companies.

A PowerPoint plug-in ensures that the results are instantly displayed as an integral part of PowerPoint.

Choose from a selection of question and graph styles that include, a countdown timer with music to limit the time the audience have to respond to the vote. The results can be shown immediately, or where sensitive, held back to be viewed after the event and can be represented as a percentage of total votes or as actual votes cast.

The voting results can be delivered to match a corporate colour scheme and text style and presented on event Power Point templates.

At the end of the event, the results are available in PowerPoint format and standard Excel results are provided for further analysis at the client’s leisure.

**Special Application**

**Attendant Call System**

This audience response system can be configured as an Attendant Call System, such as those used by Heads of States or VIPs to privately call their support staff without leaving their seat.

Due to its small credit card size and light weight, the wireless keypad is subtle and unobtrusive.

**How does it work?**

The VIP sends an alert back to a base-station by pressing any key on the device. This in turn triggers an alert to a laptop that controls the system.

The laptop displays the ID number of the keypad, thereby indicating which VIP requires assistance.

**Specific Solution**

Congress Rental provided such a system for APEC Ministers Meeting Sydney.

In this case the client wanted a single button as an attendant call button.

[ ![NewZealand](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/53-300x179.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/53.jpg)

This photo shows the attendant call unit used by the New Zealand Prime Minister. Each keypad was specifically customized to suit the event, where each Leader had a personalised unit.

Congress Rental is able to customize the keypads to any layout, applying different numbers to different actions or requirements. The cost for additional service depends upon the actual requirements.

**Aesthetic, compact discussion system**

Known for world-class solutions for congresses and conferences, Bosch introduces the compact

but advanced CCS 900 Ultro Discussion System. Designed and developed by Bosch experts in Europe, the system makes it extremely easy to manage meetings and is ideal for small- to medium-scale meeting areas, such as town halls, local business centers and courtrooms. The new design omplements any interior, from new, ultramodern buildings to traditional, centuries-old structures. It delivers Bosch's high quality with improved acoustical characteristics and excellent speech intelligibility.

**Compact but complete**

This all-in-one system features the new, patent pending "Possible-To-Speak" function that gives delegates a visual indicator when the microphone is available for use. It features an MP3 recorder that records up to 64 hours worth of discussions, four easy-to-use operating modes for more focus on the conversation and digital acoustic feedback suppression to avoid howling. Intuitive controls and flexible installation make the authentic CCS 900 Ultro the best possible choice for a wide range of meeting environments.

Excellent speech intelligibility and delegate management In small- to medium- sized applications, like townhalls or courtrooms, there may be different types of discussions, but they all need excellent speech intelligibility. The CCS 900 Ultro, a flexible solution for this type of venue, makes it easy to conduct meetings without an operator. The chairman can guide the discussion, allowing individual delegates to speak or letting several delegates take the microphone simultaneously. Delegates are guided by a visual LED to know when to speak. The daisy-chained system has an intuitive interface and is fast and easy to install. The system can easily handle external equipment like handheld microphones or a public address system to allow the audience to listen to the discussion.

**Aesthetic, compact discussion system**

Known for world-class solutions for congresses and conferences, Bosch introduces the compact

but advanced CCS 900 Ultro Discussion System. Designed and developed by Bosch experts in Europe, the system makes it extremely easy to manage meetings and is ideal for small- to medium-scale meeting areas, such as town halls, local business centers and courtrooms. The new design omplements any interior, from new, ultramodern buildings to traditional, centuries-old structures. It delivers Bosch's high quality with improved acoustical characteristics and excellent speech intelligibility.

**Compact but complete**

This all-in-one system features the new, patent pending "Possible-To-Speak" function that gives delegates a visual indicator when the microphone is available for use. It features an MP3 recorder

that records up to 64 hours worth of discussions, four easy-to-use operating modes for more focus on the conversation and digital acoustic feedback suppression to avoid howling. Intuitive controls and flexible installation make the authentic CCS 900 Ultro the best possible choice for a wide range of meeting environments.

As used at APEC in Sydney

Our Conference Microphones, sometimes called Push to Talk Microphones are quite different to Standard Table microphones. Each includes an on/off button and a built in loudspeaker and these Conference Microphones solve the problems of noise and feedback that exist with conventional microphones.

Our Conference Microphones have a chairman override function. The chairman can press their override button which temporarily mutes all other microphones.

These Conference microphones are used for any interactive discussion, in a boardroom application or a much larger conference with 200+ people all wanting to make a contribution. They have been used for Trade Negotiations, Union Meetings, International Treaty Negotiations, Training Meetings, the applications are endless, and in fact anywhere where everyone has the possibility to be heard.

**Summary**

These Microphones are often known as Table Microphones or Push-to-talk microphones. This really just means that the delegate selects when they wish to speak. Also known as Digimics® they all perform in a similar manner.

Our Conference Microphones are an ideal replacement for table microphones that don’t have a push to talk button. Standard Table microphones require the operator to turn on the delegate / panelist. Our conference microphones are turned on by the presenter; this also eliminates the possibility of any embarrasing asides being heard by the audience.

Conference Microphones are ideally suited to work with simultaneous interpretation systems. These Conference Microphones are also ideal in either Plenary or breakout areas.

The Conference Microphones come as either Wired or Wireless Conference Microphones. We use only Bosch equipment, for their high quality audio microphones and features which include Push to Talk Microphones also known at PTT Microphones and also Voice Activated Microphones.

Around the world, what we call Conference Microphones are referred to as Serial Microphones, as table microphones and as digimics ®

These Wireless &amp; Wired Conference Microphones, Push to Talk Microphones, Serial Microphones and Table Microphones have a multitude of applications. Including, High Level Government meetings, association meetings, Conference room installations, board room installations, in fact any meeting where there is interactivity.

These Conference microphones are also ideal for integrating with your Video Conferencing system and also Teleconferencing, especially where there are difficult acoustics in the room.

[ ![man with MG Mic](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09 /man-with-MG-Mic.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09 /man-with-MG-Mic.jpg)

Whatever your conference requirements, the Bosch DCN Next Generation can meet them. By bringing aesthetic appeal, reliability, flexibility and control into the proceedings. It helps you take the next step in congress system management. To create the right balance between ergonomic efficiency and aesthetic appeal, our designers consulted delegates, interpreters and operators,

and responded to their recommendations. The result is optimum satisfaction for everyone in the congress chain. With the Bosch DCN Next Generation, you can relax. Your meeting is in good hands.

**Innovation in digital congress management**

The Bosch DCN has already earned global recognition for its versatility, and DCN Next Generation continues the tradition. It is ideal for applications ranging from discussion groups up to multi-lingual congresses with thousands. On its most straight forward level, it handles speaking and listening without an operator; at its most advanced, it becomes an integrated communication infrastructure for facilitating and managing even the most complex international conferences. With Bosch DCN Next Generation, you benefit from years of expertise in congress systems. You have the reassurance of a reliable, established partner. And you can count on a support network that spans the globe.

When you think congress, think Bosch.

**System design**

[ ![381_finalrender](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09 /381_finalrender-300x240.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/381_finalrender.jpg)

The DCN Next Generation System is designed to be extraordinarily flexible. Your system can be as small or large as required, with extra units simply plugged into existing ones in a ‘loop-through’ configuration. There is also an extremely high level of compatibility with external systems.

**Aesthetic design**

[ ![NG Microphone Choices](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/NG-Microphone-Choices- 300x215.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/NG- Microphone-Choices.jpg)

Design plays a key role in how people interact with each other; it is important to create an environment that encourages constructive dialog. The DCN Next Generation offers a perfect mix of sophisticated looks and optimized performance. The layout of the sleek control panel has an instantly familiar feel. And the application of advanced acoustical and display technology makes it easy to hear and read exactly what’s going on. All of this puts users at ease, and in control.

**Concentus Table Top Units**

[ ![LBB 4145_00_2](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09 /LBB-4145_00_2-300x200.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LBB-4145_00_2.jpg)

All delegate and chairman units feature the innovative flat panel loudspeaker that improves acoustic performance (up to 20 kHz) and reduces feedback, resulting in outstanding speech intelligibility. Certain models also offer language channel selectors, ID card readers and a backlit graphical LCD screen that displays all standard Windows characters – including complex European languages and

Hi-Fi quality interpretation channels, With up to 32 language channels, the DCN Next Generation easily handles the most demanding requirements of the international congress world. Delegates may choose the floor language or any of 31 interpretations, all delivered with true Hi-Fi sound quality.

The ergonomically designed interpreter desk is a powerful, intuitive tool for interpreters. Suitable either as a table top unit or flush-mounted into a desk. It was designed after exhaustive research on how to make the interpreter’s task easier and less tiring. It is especially useful for blind users, through the logical positioning of buttons and the possibility of audible feedback. Greater interpreter satisfaction leads to higher quality, enhancing the reputation of your venue.

The desk is simply plugged into the system cabling (where it is automatically recognized), powered up, and is ready for use. This means you can easily vary the number of interpreted languages required in each room of a multi-room venue on a daily basis. Additional interpreter desks are simply added to supply extra language capacity.

An important aspect to multi-lingual conferencing is the language distribution system. DCN Next

Generation delegate positions can easily be equipped with wired, flush-mounted channel selector panels. This allows the selection of any interpretations or the floor language.

For wireless convenience, Bosch also offers the Integrus, a digital infrared language distribution system that is immune to interference from lighting systems and bright sunlight. It produces crystal-clear sound due a very high signal-to-noise ratio plus built-in error correction.

Interpreted languages are distributed to the pocket-sized receivers via infrared, giving conference delegates complete freedom of movement while listening to the chosen language interpretation on headphones. In addition, infrared transmission increases privacy, as signals do not pass through walls or ceilings.

The full potential of the DCN Next Generation is realized with PC control. A family of dedicated DCN software modules deals with all aspects of conference management and control. This increases the system’s functionality while simplifying operation. Control can be via a single PC, or distributed over several PC’s to facilitate monitoring or task delegation. Pre-conference activities – like encoding delegate ID cards and writing voting scripts – are also easier.

**Extended voting and registration functionality**

**Versatile voting**

[ ![LBB4142-00 with capsCC](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LBB4142-00-with-capsCC- 300x109.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LBB4142-00-with-capsCC.jpg)

The DCN Next Generation incorporates standard parliamentary-style voting facilities. Using dedicated application software, the possibilities can be extended to include audience response, multiple choice and rating voting. Scripts are prepared in advance, allowing results to be instantly

displayed on a video monitor or dedicated text display in the conference venue. The chairman or operator always has full control over starting, stopping and suspending voting.

**Delegate registration and identification**

[ ![Delegate registration and identification](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSCF0074_J-300x200.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSCF0074_J.jpg)

Conference participants can register their presence by inserting an ID card into a card reader that is flush-mounted, integrated into the Concentus unit, or located at the conference venue entrance. A push button on delegate units allows simple registration (without identification). It is also possible to specify that delegates may only make use of certain microphone or control functions if they possess an appropriate ID card or have entered an authorized PIN code.

**Audio expansion**

Audio logging, remote interpretation, transporting or distributing audio from one room to another room is possible over relatively long distances without loss via fibre optic cabling, by using audio

expanders (analogue or digital) which are part of DCN Next Generation. There is a growing desire to build audio systems where signal processing and amplification components are distributed through-

out a facility. Therefore DCN Next Generation interfaces easily with CobraNet&trade;,which is the industry’s leading technology for distributing uncompressed real-time digital audio over a Fast ethernet network.

**Camera control - an extra dimension in conference systems**

[ ![Dome Camera Integration](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dome-Camera-Integration- 300x196.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Dome- Camera-Integration.jpg)

A visual dimension not only generates interest and focuses attention, but also informs participants and observers (such as the press) who is speaking. The DCN Next Generation can automatically show an image of the current speaker on monitors or projection screens in the main hall, lobby, interpreters booths, breakout rooms or anywhere else required. The speaker’s name and additional information can also appear on screen. Camera control is automatic, so no constant operator attention is required. Bosch AutoDome® cameras are ideal for this application.

Congress Rental has a unique mechanism that allows a Video Dome Camera to automatically track to any microphone that is turned on, to focus on the delegate and provide a video feed output of that delegate without any user intervention.

The video dome camera integrates with the conference microphones. The video dome system can be integrated with a videoconferencing system to offer a far superior performance compared to a standard videoconferencing option. Imagine being able to do videoconferencing for 100+ people.

The system can manage an unlimited number of video dome cameras and automatically have those video dome cameras with software control automatically track to any &ldquo;live&rdquo; conference microphones at the event.

Congress Rental has developed this technology so that the video dome cameras sit on pedestals that have been optimized in height. The video dome cameras can also be hung from trusses should they be required.

Applications for this dome camera integration with microphones include: Provision of additional visibility for delegates in a large hollow square configuration. For press rooms, overflow rooms or viewing rooms, where video and audio from the main room need to be seen and heard remotely.

This system integrates standard Bosch dome cameras along with a video switcher &amp; Bosch conference microphones

**Introduction**

[ ![Introduction](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/113.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/113.jpg)

In this example (APEC 2007, Ministers Responsible for Mining meeting) The Dome Video cameras are mounted inside the hollow square and mounted in pedestals to provide an integrated look and feel.

When a Microphone is &ldquo;turned on&ldquo; the dome video camera automatically rotates and locates the &ldquo;Live Microphone&rdquo; using pre-sets in the camera. This is done without any user intervention and is unique to Bosch / Congress Rental.

The audio and video are integrated 100%. Should your meeting be of a sensitive nature or be a high security event then the system will operate without any technician support or intervention,

It takes less that ½ a second to locate and focus on a delegate.

The system can be set to show a wide angle shot of the head table or of the room whilst the camera rotates so that you don’t have to see the camera movement

**Applications**

**Large Rooms**

[ ![Large Rooms](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/114.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/114.jpg)

Where delegates are widely dispersed and a long way from each other, communication can be improved through having the delegate facial expressions shown on a large screen or on Plasma screens placed in front of delegates.

**Video Conferencing**

[ ![Video Conferencing](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/27.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/27.jpg)

This system can be seamlessly integrated into a Videoconferencing system. The Congress Rental Videoconferencing solution is particularly useful for Videoconferencing large meetings, where traditional video conferencing solutions fall down. We create a dedicated video source that inputs to the Videoconferencing system and over rides the fixed camera system.

Our Video Tracking Conferencing system eliminates acoustics problems created through widely spaced delegates and annoying background noise. This is achieved by managing limiting the number of open microphones (The more open microphones the more annoying background noise). We also automatically zoom in on the person speaking, providing a guaranteed close up of that person so that their facial expressions are crystal clear.

**Simultaneous Interpretation – Remote Interpreting**

[ ![Simultaneous Interpretation – Remote Interpreting](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/115-249x300.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/115.jpg)

Interpreters providing Simultaneous Interpretation for a meeting should ideally be near the delegates at the meeting, in order to see their expressions and understand the flow and context of the meeting through body language.

In some cases when in a large venue the Interpreters are a long way from the delegates, or when there is a small venue, the Interpreters are located in a separate room. In these situations Congress Rental provides the remote interpretation solution, whereby the speaker is always on screen for the interpreter to see &ldquo;close up&rdquo;.

In addition to the Video Tracking Microphone system which provides the close up of the speaker, we can also provide a wide screen shot of the room so the Interpreters can see the overall dynamics of the room and another separate feed of the PowerPoint presentations.

These support video technologies greatly enhance the service to the Interpreters and therefore the quality of the Interpretation.

**Media Rooms**

In cases where the media are excluded from the main Plenary, for security or other reasons, they can be accommodated in a separate room. The media monitoring of the meeting can then occur without the media entering the room.

**1.Audience Response - OCBC Bank**

Audience participation is an incredibly important aspect of any successful event. However this can become tricky to manage and encourage when an audience grows past a certain size, this is where an audience response system comes in very useful.

**THE CLIENT**

OCBC Bank is one of Asia's leading financial services groups and one of the largest financial institutions in the combined Singapore-Malaysia market. OCBC Bank is among the world's highest rated banks.

In January 2011, 800 customers attended an investment seminar hosted by OCBC Premier Banking covering equity, foreign exchange and property markets.

[image](audience_response_voting_images/case__OCBC_1.jpg)

[image](audience_response_voting_images/case__OCBC_2.jpg)

**THE CHALLENGE**

The client contacted Congress Rental in their search for professional audience response services to enable the audience to participate in live polling. To create a dialogue between the seminar speakers, the client wanted to enable live polling so that they can also gauge customer sentiments on equity, currency and property markets.

The client was hosting two seminars, one in Mandarin and one in English, which meant that **bilingual voting slides** were required for the Mandarin seminar. The organisers wanted flexibility to make amendments to the polling questions, catering for **last minute changes from the speakers** up to the point of the rehearsal.

**ACTIONS**

Congress Rental provided 480 and 320 Communicators respectively, for each run of the seminars conducted in English and Chinese, during which OCBC Premier Banking customers were polled on their views on market sentiments.

From the pre-sales stage, a producer was assigned to this project to provide seamless support throughout. Upon understanding the client’s requirements, the committee members were given a run-through of the proposed polling slides, presentation of the results and the countdown timer music. Further amendments requested for by the team were drafted, simulated within the Congress Rental system and then transmitted for review by the client. This gave the client the assurance and confidence that the outcome would match expectations.

**RESULTS**

The setup and the testing of the system went smoothly within the short timeframe. The producer was on hand to assist the Master of Ceremony and the speakers to familiarize the technology. Even though there were last minute changes and clarification from the organizing committee, these were easily incorporated into the audience response system.

The interactivity provided by the Communicator handsets meant that attendees were engaged throughout the various topics while encouraging active participation. The voting process was easy to administer and the participants were able to use the devices with ease. There was a lively atmosphere, as the Premier Banking customers were able to give their valued views on market sentiments for equity, foreign exchange and property markets. The speakers were impressed by the proficient insight given by the clientele.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> I was pleased with the professional services and responsiveness from Congress Rental. Their producer, Joan, guided us on how we could use the system right from the preparation stage. On both days of the event, they arrived ahead of schedule and set-up and integrated their audience response system seamlessly with our appointed AV vendor. The event went smoothly and I would recommend them to anyone who is planning to use audience response system for an event.&rdquo;

Andrea Han - Assistant Vice President, Marketing Services_

**2.Audience Response - Swiss Reinsurance Company**

Through the use of audience response systems, meetings and events can be made more interactive, engaging and efficient.

**THE CLIENT**

Swiss Reinsurance, headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland, is the only reinsurer with a client-centric model with teams built around their clients on a global basis.With a strong reputation in innovative reinsurance and risk management solutions, Swiss Reinsurance is committed to engage with the world to find more robust solutions to common perils.

For its flag ship Asia Claims Conference in 2010, they wanted to differentiate this conference for their clients as well as business associates.

[image](audience_response_voting_images/case__Swiss_4.jpg)

**THE CHALLENGE**

Instead of JUST talking to their participants throughout the two-day meeting, the organisers wanted to have an interactive conference where the audience is included as part of the event. When the organizing committee first went in search of the audience response solution on the internet, they had never heard of this technology.

In order to gather inputs to make improvements for the next meeting, the team wanted to receive feedback from the audience. A tradition paper-based evaluation form was thought to be too time consuming and painstaking to compile.

**ACTIONS**

To make the event more interactive, lively and productive, Swiss Reinsurance engaged Congress Rental to provide an audience response system.

The audience response system was ideal for Asian audience as it kept the audience engaged throughout the conference while building rapport between them and the various speakers. The participants were polled on various issues ranging from their concerns about the current global economic situation on the insurance market to their thoughts on claims related issues on specific industry sectors at appropriate intervals during the conference. The speakers were able to gauge the knowledge of the audience which helped them to pace their presentations. Evaluation of the presentations and event were also conducted using the interactive system, making this a greener meeting. The response rates were much higher than anticipated, where about 70% of the audience responded.

**RESULTS**

Swiss Reinsurance was able to harness the benefits of technology to capture information while maximizing feedback during the event. Attendees gave positive feedback on the enhanced interaction as the handsets added an extra dimension to the event. With the reports provided at the end of the event, Swiss Reinsurance was able to gain insights into the results and at the same time use the feedback to help shape their future events.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> We are pleased with the professional services provided from pre-sales response, proposal and clarification of our questions through to the execution and wrap up of the event.

Member of Organising Committee

	> We are very impressed with the fantastic consultation provided by Congress Rental. Jeremy Ducklin, their Managing Director, flew down personally from Australia to ensure that all details are taken care of. I have recommended their services to many of our business associates.

Patricia Mack, Vice President, Claims &amp; Liabilities

	> This was our first time using an Audience Response System so we were concerned about its reliability. But we need not have worried as everything went 100%. We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of information that we gathered from the post event reports because of the high response rates! We can’t wait to utilize even more features of the Communicator at our next meeting

**3.Silent Auction - Special Olympics**

**THE CLIENT**

Special Olympics is an international non-profit organisation that changes lives by encouraging and empowering people with intellectual disabilities, promoting acceptance for all, and fostering community understanding and respect worldwide through sports training and athletic competition. Funding comes from a variety or sources including special events, corporate partnerships, government support, and private donors.

**THE CHALLENGE**

In October 2010, The American Chamber of Commerce sponsored a Gala Dinner in support of Special Olympics. The dinner, which aimed to raise funds for a variety of programs, was the first time Special Olympics opted to use **silent auction technology.** Unfamiliar with bidding technology, Special Olympics staff were unsure if the guests would be receptive to using the devices.

**ACTIONS**

Special Olympics engaged Congress Rental to provide their 200 guests with the silent auction technology through the use of keypads and smart cards for each guest to track bidding details.

As part of their full-service approach, Congress Rental assigned a producer to handle the project from end-to-end.

From the preparation stage, where the silent auction summary screens were prepared, to the loading of lot items and guests list right through to the execution during the gala dinner. To give Special Olympics the assurance that the outcome would be as expected, samples and drafts of the silent auction summary screen and invoices were prepared for review by the committee before being finalized.

Jeremy Ducklin, the Managing Director of Congress Rental, was personally present at the event to lend his expertise, to all aspects of the silent auction. This gave additional confidence to the committee on the quality delivery of the technology.

**RESULTS**

During the event, the lot items and bids were broadcast on giant screens throughout the ballroom. From the comfort of their dinner table, guests could see how their bids stacked up against the competition. There was great buzz as guests tried to outbid one another for the most sought after items. For example, actress Zhang Ziyi’s Personal Constellation Style Omega Wristwatch with a starting bid of $1,000 went for eight times that!

Special Olympics staff was delighted by the atmosphere created and the funds raised which far exceeded their expectations. They were able to benefit from the use of silent auction technology as the results and invoices were instantly available at the close of the silent auction. There was no need for a last minute rush from the volunteers to manually tabulate the bid sheets and create invoices.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> We are so pleased with the services provided by Congress Rental that we plan to include this segment in our future fundraisers, not only in Singapore but also around the region.

Mr. David Rutherford, Regional President &amp; Managing Director of Special Olympics Asia Pacific

	> Our guests were so enthusiastic that they were at the check-out counter before we were ready! I was glad that the reports and invoices were available so soon after the silent auction was closed. 

Ms Pamella Odhner, Director Organizational Development.

**4.Silent Auction - Pistorio Foundation**

**THE CLIENT**

The Pistorio Foundation is a non-profit organization based in Geneva, Switzerland, founded by Pasquale Pistorio in April 2005. It works to provide assistance to under privileged children in the field of health, nutrition, and education, by sponsoring children’s education and health and by building and improving school infrastructures. The Pistorio Foundation also supports programs for village community development.

The Pistorio Foundation has projects in five countries: Burkina Faso, Tibet (China), Thailand, Cambodia and Morocco.

**THE CHALLENGE**

The Pistorio Foundation Singapore Chapter held its third annual Gala Dinner on November 30th, 2010, at the Shangri-La Hotel Tower Ballroom. The &ldquo;Dolce Vita&rdquo; themed event was realised in partnership with the Italian Trade Commission and supported by the Italian Cultural Institute. The Organising Committee wanted to leverage the Silent Auction technology to reach their goals of raising funds at this event to support 360 under-privileged hill-tribe children in Chiang Rai, Thailand during the silent auction segment of their fund raising event.

[image](audience_response_voting_images/case_Pistorio_3.jpg)

**ACTIONS**

Pistorio Foundation expected about 200 guests for this event and engaged Congress Rental to provide them with the solution for the Silent Auction and Pledging segment.

Elena Pistorio, Chairman of the Organising Committee, was not sure what to expect as it was the first time they are using this fundraising technology. To give them the assurance, a producer was assigned to handle this project from the preparation stage through to the execution as a single point of contact.

As the Organising Committee had not seen pledging done previously, they were not sure if they wanted to proceed with it. To give them a better idea, Congress Rental went ahead to prepare the draft for the pledging screen for each project to show them how it would look during the presentation. After much consideration, the committee decided to give it a try as the funds were required urgently to benefit the children.

The Pistorio Foundation decided to utilize the Pledge feature to get their guests to contribute to 3 main projects, namely a long-term scholarship, a library and a computer room for a primary school in Huay Kuk, Chiang Rai.

**RESULTS**

Pistorio Foundation was absolutely delighted with the outcome as they reached their target for the silent auction and pledging segment for the event.

The result from the pledge was heartening as 2 of the projects exceeded the target. This was an unexpected win as this is the first time pledging was introduced for as part of their event. Pistorio Foundation was able to provide 2 children with long-term scholarship instead of 1 as initially planned.

The check-out was well managed as the summary reports were provided to the volunteers tending to the different payment modes upon closure of the auction. At the same time the guests were making the payment, invoices were provided to them, saving both time and efforts in verification of details and mailing.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> Congress Rental was attentive to our guests’ needs and was able to provide our VIPs with their individualized smart cards at short notice when they requested to join in the excitement during the bidding.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Our guests reflected that it was great way to do a silent auction, as there is no need to leave their seats to bid!&rdquo;

&ldquo;I was very pleased with the professional service, from the pre-sales consultation, preparation through to the execution. I am confident that I can keep the silent auction going on for longer to raise more funds, for our next event.&ldquo;_

Elena Pistorio, Board Member of Pistorio Foundation and Chairman of Event Organizing Committee

A standard Conference Microphone set-up can be enhanced with the use of Software Control and Microphone Management Software, allowing the chairman or our technician to control the microphones in the room. There are many ways in which the Software control of microphones enhances the meeting:

The Software can tell you who requested to speak first.

With large numbers of delegates, its easy to locate the person speaking

The correct meeting protocol is easy to implement.

The chairman knows immediately who is in the queue ready to speak.

A delegate microphone accidentally left on can be remotely switched off.

Managing the time allocated to delegates is easy.

**How it works!**

[ ![mics, dome software ctrl cropped](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mics-dome-sftware-ctrl-cropped- 300x233.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mics- dome-sftware-ctrl-cropped.jpg)

Software queuing is an additional feature that can be added to our microphone systems.

The chairman is provided a screen that shows a layout of the room showing the microphones and also a list of the delegates wishing to speak.

The technician at the back of the room has control of the system. The laptop screen is replicated for the chairman, so the chairman has full visibility on proceedings. The chairman then directs the meeting as they wish and the technician operates according to these directions.

Congress Rental technicians are qualified either directly by Bosch or through a rigorous internal training program.

Full system checks are undertaken prior to all events. The equipment is then re-checked each day prior to the start of the day’s event. Technicians are always available on site at least 1 hour prior to the commencement of the event and earlier on the first day.

Our technicians are trained to problem solve and resolve issues, should they occur. They pay particular attention to ensuring that all cabling is discreet or hidden, and to ensure there are no safety hazards created.

Our technicians constantly monitor the interpreter’s input and output to ensure that any issues are rectified immediately, often before delegates know that a problem exists.

**1.Audience Response - OCBC Bank**

Audience participation is an incredibly important aspect of any successful event. However this can become tricky to manage and encourage when an audience grows past a certain size, this is where an audience response system comes in very useful.

**THE CLIENT**

OCBC Bank is one of Asia's leading financial services groups and one of the largest financial institutions in the combined Singapore-Malaysia market. OCBC Bank is among the world's highest rated banks.

In January 2011, 800 customers attended an investment seminar hosted by OCBC Premier Banking covering equity, foreign exchange and property markets.

[image](audience_response_voting_images/case__OCBC_1.jpg)

[image](audience_response_voting_images/case__OCBC_2.jpg)

**THE CHALLENGE**

The client contacted Congress Rental in their search for professional audience response services to enable the audience to participate in live polling. To create a dialogue between the seminar speakers, the client wanted to enable live polling so that they can also gauge customer sentiments on equity, currency and property markets.

The client was hosting two seminars, one in Mandarin and one in English, which meant that **bilingual voting slides** were required for the Mandarin seminar. The organisers wanted flexibility to make amendments to the polling questions, catering for **last minute changes from the speakers** up to the point of the rehearsal.

**ACTIONS**

Congress Rental provided 480 and 320 Communicators respectively, for each run of the seminars conducted in English and Chinese, during which OCBC Premier Banking customers were polled on their views on market sentiments.

From the pre-sales stage, a producer was assigned to this project to provide seamless support throughout. Upon understanding the client’s requirements, the committee members were given a run-through of the proposed polling slides, presentation of the results and the countdown timer music. Further amendments requested for by the team were drafted, simulated within the Congress Rental system and then transmitted for review by the client. This gave the client the assurance and confidence that the outcome would match expectations.

**RESULTS**

The setup and the testing of the system went smoothly within the short timeframe. The producer was on hand to assist the Master of Ceremony and the speakers to familiarize the technology. Even though there were last minute changes and clarification from the organizing committee, these were easily incorporated into the audience response system.

The interactivity provided by the Communicator handsets meant that attendees were engaged throughout the various topics while encouraging active participation. The voting process was easy to administer and the participants were able to use the devices with ease. There was a lively atmosphere, as the Premier Banking customers were able to give their valued views on market sentiments for equity, foreign exchange and property markets. The speakers were impressed by the proficient insight given by the clientele.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> I was pleased with the professional services and responsiveness from Congress Rental. Their producer, Joan, guided us on how we could use the system right from the preparation stage. On both days of the event, they arrived ahead of schedule and set-up and integrated their audience response system seamlessly with our appointed AV vendor. The event went smoothly and I would recommend them to anyone who is planning to use audience response system for an event.&rdquo;

Andrea Han - Assistant Vice President, Marketing Services_

**2.Audience Response - Swiss Reinsurance Company**

Through the use of audience response systems, meetings and events can be made more interactive, engaging and efficient.

**THE CLIENT**

Swiss Reinsurance, headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland, is the only reinsurer with a client-centric model with teams built around their clients on a global basis.With a strong reputation in innovative reinsurance and risk management solutions, Swiss Reinsurance is committed to engage with the world to find more robust solutions to common perils.

For its flag ship Asia Claims Conference in 2010, they wanted to differentiate this conference for their clients as well as business associates.

[image](audience_response_voting_images/case__Swiss_4.jpg)

**THE CHALLENGE**

Instead of JUST talking to their participants throughout the two-day meeting, the organisers wanted to have an interactive conference where the audience is included as part of the event. When the organizing committee first went in search of the audience response solution on the internet, they had never heard of this technology.

In order to gather inputs to make improvements for the next meeting, the team wanted to receive feedback from the audience. A tradition paper-based evaluation form was thought to be too time consuming and painstaking to compile.

**ACTIONS**

To make the event more interactive, lively and productive, Swiss Reinsurance engaged Congress Rental to provide an audience response system.

The audience response system was ideal for Asian audience as it kept the audience engaged throughout the conference while building rapport between them and the various speakers. The participants were polled on various issues ranging from their concerns about the current global economic situation on the insurance market to their thoughts on claims related issues on specific industry sectors at appropriate intervals during the conference. The speakers were able to gauge the knowledge of the audience which helped them to pace their presentations. Evaluation of the presentations and event were also conducted using the interactive system, making this a greener meeting. The response rates were much higher than anticipated, where about 70% of the audience responded.

**RESULTS**

Swiss Reinsurance was able to harness the benefits of technology to capture information while maximizing feedback during the event. Attendees gave positive feedback on the enhanced interaction as the handsets added an extra dimension to the event. With the reports provided at the end of the event, Swiss Reinsurance was able to gain insights into the results and at the same time use the feedback to help shape their future events.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> We are pleased with the professional services provided from pre-sales response, proposal and clarification of our questions through to the execution and wrap up of the event.

Member of Organising Committee

	> We are very impressed with the fantastic consultation provided by Congress Rental. Jeremy Ducklin, their Managing Director, flew down personally from Australia to ensure that all details are taken care of. I have recommended their services to many of our business associates.

Patricia Mack, Vice President, Claims &amp; Liabilities

	> This was our first time using an Audience Response System so we were concerned about its reliability. But we need not have worried as everything went 100%. We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of information that we gathered from the post event reports because of the high response rates! We can’t wait to utilize even more features of the Communicator at our next meeting

**3.Silent Auction - Special Olympics**

**THE CLIENT**

Special Olympics is an international non-profit organisation that changes lives by encouraging and empowering people with intellectual disabilities, promoting acceptance for all, and fostering community understanding and respect worldwide through sports training and athletic competition. Funding comes from a variety or sources including special events, corporate partnerships, government support, and private donors.

**THE CHALLENGE**

In October 2010, The American Chamber of Commerce sponsored a Gala Dinner in support of Special Olympics. The dinner, which aimed to raise funds for a variety of programs, was the first time Special Olympics opted to use **silent auction technology.** Unfamiliar with bidding technology, Special Olympics staff were unsure if the guests would be receptive to using the devices.

**ACTIONS**

Special Olympics engaged Congress Rental to provide their 200 guests with the silent auction technology through the use of keypads and smart cards for each guest to track bidding details.

As part of their full-service approach, Congress Rental assigned a producer to handle the project from end-to-end.

From the preparation stage, where the silent auction summary screens were prepared, to the loading of lot items and guests list right through to the execution during the gala dinner. To give Special Olympics the assurance that the outcome would be as expected, samples and drafts of the silent auction summary screen and invoices were prepared for review by the committee before being finalized.

Jeremy Ducklin, the Managing Director of Congress Rental, was personally present at the event to lend his expertise, to all aspects of the silent auction. This gave additional confidence to the committee on the quality delivery of the technology.

**RESULTS**

During the event, the lot items and bids were broadcast on giant screens throughout the ballroom. From the comfort of their dinner table, guests could see how their bids stacked up against the competition. There was great buzz as guests tried to outbid one another for the most sought after items. For example, actress Zhang Ziyi’s Personal Constellation Style Omega Wristwatch with a starting bid of $1,000 went for eight times that!

Special Olympics staff was delighted by the atmosphere created and the funds raised which far exceeded their expectations. They were able to benefit from the use of silent auction technology as the results and invoices were instantly available at the close of the silent auction. There was no need for a last minute rush from the volunteers to manually tabulate the bid sheets and create invoices.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> We are so pleased with the services provided by Congress Rental that we plan to include this segment in our future fundraisers, not only in Singapore but also around the region.

Mr. David Rutherford, Regional President &amp; Managing Director of Special Olympics Asia Pacific

	> Our guests were so enthusiastic that they were at the check-out counter before we were ready! I was glad that the reports and invoices were available so soon after the silent auction was closed. 

Ms Pamella Odhner, Director Organizational Development.

**4.Silent Auction - Pistorio Foundation**

**THE CLIENT**

The Pistorio Foundation is a non-profit organization based in Geneva, Switzerland, founded by Pasquale Pistorio in April 2005. It works to provide assistance to under privileged children in the field of health, nutrition, and education, by sponsoring children’s education and health and by building and improving school infrastructures. The Pistorio Foundation also supports programs for village community development.

The Pistorio Foundation has projects in five countries: Burkina Faso, Tibet (China), Thailand, Cambodia and Morocco.

**THE CHALLENGE**

The Pistorio Foundation Singapore Chapter held its third annual Gala Dinner on November 30th, 2010, at the Shangri-La Hotel Tower Ballroom. The &ldquo;Dolce Vita&rdquo; themed event was realised in partnership with the Italian Trade Commission and supported by the Italian Cultural Institute. The Organising Committee wanted to leverage the Silent Auction technology to reach their goals of raising funds at this event to support 360 under-privileged hill-tribe children in Chiang Rai, Thailand during the silent auction segment of their fund raising event.

[image](audience_response_voting_images/case_Pistorio_2.jpg)

[image](audience_response_voting_images/case_Pistorio_3.jpg)

**ACTIONS**

Pistorio Foundation expected about 200 guests for this event and engaged Congress Rental to provide them with the solution for the Silent Auction and Pledging segment.

Elena Pistorio, Chairman of the Organising Committee, was not sure what to expect as it was the first time they are using this fundraising technology. To give them the assurance, a producer was assigned to handle this project from the preparation stage through to the execution as a single point of contact.

As the Organising Committee had not seen pledging done previously, they were not sure if they wanted to proceed with it. To give them a better idea, Congress Rental went ahead to prepare the draft for the pledging screen for each project to show them how it would look during the presentation. After much consideration, the committee decided to give it a try as the funds were required urgently to benefit the children.

The Pistorio Foundation decided to utilize the Pledge feature to get their guests to contribute to 3 main projects, namely a long-term scholarship, a library and a computer room for a primary school in Huay Kuk, Chiang Rai.

**RESULTS**

Pistorio Foundation was absolutely delighted with the outcome as they reached their target for the silent auction and pledging segment for the event.

The result from the pledge was heartening as 2 of the projects exceeded the target. This was an unexpected win as this is the first time pledging was introduced for as part of their event. Pistorio Foundation was able to provide 2 children with long-term scholarship instead of 1 as initially planned.

The check-out was well managed as the summary reports were provided to the volunteers tending to the different payment modes upon closure of the auction. At the same time the guests were making the payment, invoices were provided to them, saving both time and efforts in verification of details and mailing.

**THE CLIENT**

Special Olympics is an international non-profit organisation that changes lives by encouraging and empowering people with intellectual disabilities, promoting acceptance for all, and fostering community understanding and respect worldwide through sports training and athletic competition. Funding comes from a variety or sources including special events, corporate partnerships, government support, and private donors.

**THE CHALLENGE**

In October 2010, The American Chamber of Commerce sponsored a Gala Dinner in support of Special Olympics. The dinner, which aimed to raise funds for a variety of programs, was the first time Special Olympics opted to use **silent auction technology.** Unfamiliar with bidding technology, Special Olympics staff were unsure if the guests would be receptive to using the devices.

**ACTIONS**

Special Olympics engaged Congress Rental to provide their 200 guests with the silent auction technology through the use of keypads and smart cards for each guest to track bidding details.

As part of their full-service approach, Congress Rental assigned a producer to handle the project from end-to-end.

From the preparation stage, where the silent auction summary screens were prepared, to the loading of lot items and guests list right through to the execution during the gala dinner. To give Special Olympics the assurance that the outcome would be as expected, samples and drafts of the silent auction summary screen and invoices were prepared for review by the committee before being finalized.

Jeremy Ducklin, the Managing Director of Congress Rental, was personally present at the event to lend his expertise, to all aspects of the silent auction. This gave additional confidence to the committee on the quality delivery of the technology.

**RESULTS**

During the event, the lot items and bids were broadcast on giant screens throughout the ballroom. From the comfort of their dinner table, guests could see how their bids stacked up against the competition. There was great buzz as guests tried to outbid one another for the most sought after items. For example, actress Zhang Ziyi’s Personal Constellation Style Omega Wristwatch with a starting bid of $1,000 went for eight times that!

Special Olympics staff was delighted by the atmosphere created and the funds raised which far exceeded their expectations. They were able to benefit from the use of silent auction technology as the results and invoices were instantly available at the close of the silent auction. There was no need for a last minute rush from the volunteers to manually tabulate the bid sheets and create invoices.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> We are so pleased with the services provided by Congress Rental that we plan to include this segment in our future fundraisers, not only in Singapore but also around the region.

Mr. David Rutherford, Regional President &amp; Managing Director of Special Olympics Asia Pacific

	> Our guests were so enthusiastic that they were at the check-out counter before we were ready! I was glad that the reports and invoices were available so soon after the silent auction was closed.

**THE CLIENT**

The Pistorio Foundation Singapore Chapter held its third annual Gala Dinner on November 30th, 2010, at the Shangri-La Hotel Tower Ballroom. The &ldquo;Dolce Vita&rdquo; themed event was realised in partnership with the Italian Trade Commission and supported by the Italian Cultural Institute. The Organising Committee wanted to leverage the Silent Auction technology to reach their goals of raising funds at this event to support 360 under-privileged hill-tribe children in Chiang Rai, Thailand during the silent auction segment of their fund raising event.

**ACTIONS**

Pistorio Foundation expected about 200 guests for this event and engaged Congress Rental to provide them with the solution for the Silent Auction and Pledging segment.

Elena Pistorio, Chairman of the Organising Committee, was not sure what to expect as it was the first time they are using this fundraising technology. To give them the assurance, a producer was assigned to handle this project from the preparation stage through to the execution as a single point of contact.

As the Organising Committee had not seen pledging done previously, they were not sure if they wanted to proceed with it. To give them a better idea, Congress Rental went ahead to prepare the draft for the pledging screen for each project to show them how it would look during the presentation. After much consideration, the committee decided to give it a try as the funds were required urgently to benefit the children.

The Pistorio Foundation decided to utilize the Pledge feature to get their guests to contribute to 3 main projects, namely a long-term scholarship, a library and a computer room for a primary school in Huay Kuk, Chiang Rai.

**RESULTS**

Audience participation is an incredibly important aspect of any successful event. However this can become tricky to manage and encourage when an audience grows past a certain size, this is where an audience response system comes in very useful.

**THE CLIENT**

![OCBC bank](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case__OCBC_1.jpg)

![OCBC bank](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case__OCBC_2.jpg)

OCBC Bank is one of Asia’s leading financial services groups and one of the largest financial institutions in the combined Singapore-Malaysia market. OCBC Bank is among the world’s highest rated banks.

In January 2011, 800 customers attended an investment seminar hosted by OCBC Premier Banking covering equity, foreign exchange and property markets.

**THE CHALLENGE**

The client contacted Congress Rental in their search for professional audience response services to enable the audience to participate in live polling. To create a dialogue between the seminar speakers, the client wanted to enable live polling so that they can also gauge customer sentiments on equity, currency and property markets.

The client was hosting two seminars, one in Mandarin and one in English, which meant that **bilingual voting slides** were required for the Mandarin seminar. The organisers wanted flexibility to make amendments to the polling questions, catering for **last minute changes from the speakers** up to the point of the rehearsal.

**ACTIONS**

Congress Rental provided 480 and 320 Communicators respectively, for each run of the seminars conducted in English and Chinese, during which OCBC Premier Banking customers were polled on their views on market sentiments.

From the pre-sales stage, a producer was assigned to this project to provide seamless support throughout. Upon understanding the client’s requirements, the committee members were given a run-through of the proposed polling slides, presentation of the results and the countdown timer music. Further amendments requested for by the team were drafted, simulated within the Congress Rental system and then transmitted for review by the client. This gave the client the assurance and confidence that the outcome would match expectations.

**RESULTS**

![OCBC bank](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case__OCBC_3.jpg)

The setup and the testing of the system went smoothly within the short timeframe. The producer was on hand to assist the Master of Ceremony and the speakers to familiarize the technology. Even though there were last minute changes and clarification from the organizing committee, these were easily incorporated into the audience response system.

The interactivity provided by the Communicator handsets meant that attendees were engaged throughout the various topics while encouraging active participation. The voting process was easy to administer and the participants were able to use the devices with ease. There was a lively atmosphere, as the Premier Banking customers were able to give their valued views on market sentiments for equity, foreign exchange and property markets. The speakers were impressed by the proficient insight given by the clientele.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> I was pleased with the professional services and responsiveness from Congress Rental. Their producer, Joan, guided us on how we could use the system right from the preparation stage. On both days of the event, they arrived ahead of schedule and set-up and integrated their audience response system seamlessly with our appointed AV vendor. The event went smoothly and I would recommend them to anyone who is planning to use audience response system for an event.

**THE CLIENT**

Swiss Reinsurance, headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland, is the only reinsurer with a client-centric model with teams built around their clients on a global basis.With a strong reputation in innovative reinsurance and risk management solutions, Swiss Reinsurance is committed to engage with the world to find more robust solutions to common perils.

For its flag ship Asia Claims Conference in 2010, they wanted to differentiate this conference for their clients as well as business associates.

**THE CHALLENGE**

Instead of JUST talking to their participants throughout the two-day meeting, the organisers wanted to have an interactive conference where the audience is included as part of the event. When the organizing committee first went in search of the audience response solution on the internet, they had never heard of this technology.

In order to gather inputs to make improvements for the next meeting, the team wanted to receive feedback from the audience. A tradition paper-based evaluation form was thought to be too time consuming and painstaking to compile.

**ACTIONS**

To make the event more interactive, lively and productive, Swiss Reinsurance engaged Congress Rental to provide an audience response system.

The audience response system was ideal for Asian audience as it kept the audience engaged throughout the conference while building rapport between them and the various speakers. The participants were polled on various issues ranging from their concerns about the current global economic situation on the insurance market to their thoughts on claims related issues on specific industry sectors at appropriate intervals during the conference. The speakers were able to gauge the knowledge of the audience which helped them to pace their presentations. Evaluation of the presentations and event were also conducted using the interactive system, making this a greener meeting. The response rates were much higher than anticipated, where about 70% of the audience responded.

**RESULTS**

Swiss Reinsurance was able to harness the benefits of technology to capture information while maximizing feedback during the event. Attendees gave positive feedback on the enhanced interaction as the handsets added an extra dimension to the event. With the reports provided at the end of the event, Swiss Reinsurance was able to gain insights into the results and at the same time use the feedback to help shape their future events.

[ ![DCN_NG_APH57](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DCN_ NG_APH57-198x300.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DCN_NG_APH57.jpg)

Silent PA is where we use the multichannel distribution functionality of the Bosch Simultaneous Interpretation system to provide a solution for Exhibitions, Gyms and teaching environments where a dedicated audio channel is required for some people, but not for everyone.

**The Problem**

The Problem at Exhibitions is that there a large number of audio sources all competing for the attention of the attendee. This makes it very difficult for an exhibitor to convey a message requiring either a focus of attention or privacy.

**The Solution**

The solution is Silent PA. Each delegate is provided a receiver and headset. The delegate then chooses the channel that corresponds to the audio channel of interest. This can be a single channel or multiple channels up to 32. This allows delegates to go to multiple booths and listen to the sound track or presenter associated with that booth without audio interference from adjacent booths.

**Training Sessions**

[ ![Training Sessions](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_6024-300x194.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_6024.jpg)

Where multiple training sessions are to be conducted in a common area, the Silent PA system provides the perfect solution. In the picture shown there were 5 presenters each with different presentations. The trainee’s used the computers to enhance the training and could follow any one of the 5 topics being presented by simply selecting the appropriate channel on the Receiver.

**Gyms**

[ ![Gyms](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC01599-300x199.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC01599.jpg)

Gym users are keen to be entertained with a variety of video and audio sources whilst they are at the gym. The infrared system allows each fitness fanatic to select the audio channel they prefer without the need for disturbing their neighbour. These can be audio channels corresponding to a radio station, video or TV.

Congress is the leading and largest provider of simultaneous interpretation equipment and conference microphones in Australia. We also have offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane / Gold Coast and Operate throughout New Zealand and the Pacific Region. Our Sister company Congress Rental Pte Ltd is based in Singapore and operates throughout Asia.

Our Simultaneous Interpretation equipment, also known sometimes as Simultaneous Translation, Translation equipment or Simtran Equipment is Bosch equipment and is the best available. Our Simultaneous Interpretation Rental equipment stock is mostly under 2 years old and our aim is to continually replace the equipment so that customers get the best Interpretation equipment available.

**Booths**

Our booths are the only ones in Australia that are truly ISO4043 compliant. Our soundproof certification testing shows that they are truly soundproof. These booths are always supplied with fans in the roof that provide the required amount of air circulation. Interpreters love our sound proof booths!

Check that all your possible suppliers have soundproof certification. Download our Booth Specifications. Some suppliers have a hole in the roof and call it ventilation! Ask for photos. Other suppliers have gaps in the side of their booths, that are part of the construction process. Ask us for a demo or see our equipment in use and see the difference.

Our Booth external Dimensions are 1720mm (W) x 1720mm (D) x 2280mm (H)

**Integrus Digital Receivers**

[ ![Integrus Digital Receivers](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/11-300x219.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/11.jpg)

[Click here to watch Integrus Flash movie (2MB) On our Receivers](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/INT-film- en.exe)

Our receivers are Truly Digital. This ensures that they are Interference free 100% guaranteed! We can guarantee that we will be able to use each channel from Channel 1 through to Channel 32 Consecutively and without noise. If your supplier does not have Bosch Integrus Digital Receivers they can’t make the same promise.

We previously had Analogue technology and know its susceptible to lighting and other ambient noise sources. So we know the pitfalls and problems. If you are comparing us with a cheaper price then ask us for an analogue solution.

**Our Radiators**

[ ![Radiators](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2-300x233.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2.jpg)

Our Radiators are 25Watts. This means that you get the largest coverage with the least number of radiators. We guarantee the coverage, as we carefully calculate the number of radiators required based on the number of channels and area to be covered.

**Our People**

[ ![Certificate](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/3-210x300.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/3.jpg)

Congress Rental technicians are qualified either directly by Bosch or through a rigorous internal training program.

Full system checks are undertaken prior to all events. The equipment is then re-checked each day prior to the start of the day’s event. Technicians are always available on site at least 1 hour prior to the commencement of the event and earlier on the first day.

Our technicians are trained to problem solve and resolve issues, should they occur. They pay particular attention to ensuring that all cabling is discreet or hidden, and to ensure there are no safety hazards created.

Our technicians constantly monitor the interpreter’s input and output to ensure that any issues are rectified immediately, often before delegates know that a problem exists.

**Simultaneous Interpretation Equipment – A complete solution**

Congress Rental makes the process of adding Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) to a conference or meeting straight forward. We are specialists in this field and can advise you on all aspects relating to Simultaneous Interpretation SI. Our liaison with your designated venue is seamless as we have previously installed in most venues. We interface with your audio visual company and we manage all areas of service – bump in, installation, operation and bump out – in consultation with you, and without the need for supervision. We also manage the freight including duties, customs, carnet’s and local delivery.

[ ![overview](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/4-300x199.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/4.jpg)

Congress Rental also undertakes detailed project management for all projects, ensuring they remain stress free for clients. An example of this is our policy of sending equipment to distant venues at least two days before it is required, thereby eliminating possible freight problems.

Congress Rental is a specialist provider of Simultaneous Interpretation Equipment and will ensure the successful Interpretation of your event.

[ ![Congress Rental Network](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/113.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/113.jpg)

[ ![Congress Rental Network](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/32.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/32.jpg)

Congress Rental has a unique mechanism that allows a Video Dome Camera to automatically track to any microphone that is turned on, to focus on the delegate and provide a video feed output of that delegate without any user intervention.

The video dome camera integrates with the conference microphones. The video dome system can be integrated with a videoconferencing system to offer a far superior performance compared to a standard videoconferencing option. Imagine being able to do videoconferencing for 100+ people.

The system can manage an unlimited number of video dome cameras and automatically have those video dome cameras with software control automatically track to any &ldquo;live&rdquo; conference microphones at the event.

Congress Rental has developed this technology so that the video dome cameras sit on pedestals that have been optimized in height. The video dome cameras can also be hung from trusses should they be required.

Applications for this dome camera integration with microphones include: Provision of additional visibility for delegates in a large hollow square configuration. For press rooms, overflow rooms or viewing rooms, where video and audio from the main room need to be seen and heard remotely.

This system integrates standard Bosch dome cameras along with a video switcher &amp; Bosch conference microphones

**Introduction**

[ ![Introduction](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/113.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/113.jpg)

In this example (APEC 2007, Ministers Responsible for Mining meeting) The Dome Video cameras are mounted inside the hollow square and mounted in pedestals to provide an integrated look and feel.

When a Microphone is &ldquo;turned on&ldquo; the dome video camera automatically rotates and locates the &ldquo;Live Microphone&rdquo; using pre-sets in the camera. This is done without any user intervention and is unique to Bosch / Congress Rental.

The audio and video are integrated 100%. Should your meeting be of a sensitive nature or be a high security event then the system will operate without any technician support or intervention,

It takes less that ½ a second to locate and focus on a delegate.

The system can be set to show a wide angle shot of the head table or of the room whilst the camera rotates so that you don’t have to see the camera movement

**Applications**

**Large Rooms**

[ ![Large Rooms](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/114.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/114.jpg)

Where delegates are widely dispersed and a long way from each other, communication can be improved through having the delegate facial expressions shown on a large screen or on Plasma screens placed in front of delegates.

**Video Conferencing**

[ ![Video Conferencing](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/27.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/27.jpg)

This system can be seamlessly integrated into a Videoconferencing system. The Congress Rental Videoconferencing solution is particularly useful for Videoconferencing large meetings, where traditional video conferencing solutions fall down. We create a dedicated video source that inputs to the Videoconferencing system and over rides the fixed camera system.

Our Video Tracking Conferencing system eliminates acoustics problems created through widely spaced delegates and annoying background noise. This is achieved by managing limiting the number of open microphones (The more open microphones the more annoying background noise). We also automatically zoom in on the person speaking, providing a guaranteed close up of that person so that their facial expressions are crystal clear.

**Simultaneous Interpretation – Remote Interpreting**

[ ![Simultaneous Interpretation – Remote Interpreting](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/115-249x300.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/115.jpg)

Interpreters providing Simultaneous Interpretation for a meeting should ideally be near the delegates at the meeting, in order to see their expressions and understand the flow and context of the meeting through body language.

In some cases when in a large venue the Interpreters are a long way from the delegates, or when there is a small venue, the Interpreters are located in a separate room. In these situations Congress Rental provides the remote interpretation solution, whereby the speaker is always on screen for the interpreter to see &ldquo;close up&rdquo;.

In addition to the Video Tracking Microphone system which provides the close up of the speaker, we can also provide a wide screen shot of the room so the Interpreters can see the overall dynamics of the room and another separate feed of the PowerPoint presentations.

These support video technologies greatly enhance the service to the Interpreters and therefore the quality of the Interpretation.

**Media Rooms**

In cases where the media are excluded from the main Plenary, for security or other reasons, they can be accommodated in a separate room. The media monitoring of the meeting can then occur without the media entering the room.

As used at APEC in Sydney

Our Conference Microphones, sometimes called Push to Talk Microphones are quite different to Standard Table microphones. Each includes an on/off button and a built in loudspeaker and these Conference Microphones solve the problems of noise and feedback that exist with conventional microphones.

Our Conference Microphones have a chairman override function. The chairman can press their override button which temporarily mutes all other microphones.

These Conference microphones are used for any interactive discussion, in a boardroom application or a much larger conference with 200+ people all wanting to make a contribution. They have been used for Trade Negotiations, Union Meetings, International Treaty Negotiations, Training Meetings, the applications are endless, and in fact anywhere where everyone has the possibility to be heard.

**Summary**

These Microphones are often known as Table Microphones or Push-to-talk microphones. This really just means that the delegate selects when they wish to speak. Also known as Digimics® they all perform in a similar manner.

Our Conference Microphones are an ideal replacement for table microphones that don’t have a push to talk button. Standard Table microphones require the operator to turn on the delegate / panelist. Our conference microphones are turned on by the presenter; this also eliminates the possibility of any embarrasing asides being heard by the audience.

Conference Microphones are ideally suited to work with simultaneous interpretation systems. These Conference Microphones are also ideal in either Plenary or breakout areas.

The Conference Microphones come as either Wired or Wireless Conference Microphones. We use only Bosch equipment, for their high quality audio microphones and features which include Push to Talk Microphones also known at PTT Microphones and also Voice Activated Microphones.

Around the world, what we call Conference Microphones are referred to as Serial Microphones, as table microphones and as digimics ®

These Wireless &amp; Wired Conference Microphones, Push to Talk Microphones, Serial Microphones and Table Microphones have a multitude of applications. Including, High Level Government meetings, association meetings, Conference room installations, board room installations, in fact any meeting where there is interactivity.

These Conference microphones are also ideal for integrating with your Video Conferencing system and also Teleconferencing, especially where there are difficult acoustics in the room.

[ ![Quiz Night](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Quiz- Night-cropped-150ppi-300x201.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Quiz-Night-cropped-150ppi.jpg)

  * Every member of your audience is given a voting handset.   * Questions are displayed to the audience   * Participants select their answer   * The vote is closed and the results are instantly displayed

At Congress Rental, we provide wireless audience response systems that transmit data from the keypads to the base station via Radio Frequency (2.4 GHz WIFI). This ensures that we can cater to both small and large groups on a single base station. The data travels via Radio Frequency, therefore participants merely need to be within range of the base station, and need not maintain line-of-sight between keypads and the receiver.

A producer will be on-site to operate the chosen audience response solution.

At the end of the event, detailed voting results will be provided for client to perform further analysis.

**What do delegates using Audience Response Systems say?**

&ldquo;When I was given the handset, I felt that my opinion was being valued.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It feels powerful as I am able to influence and help shape the outcomes of the conference.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It helps us, the participants, to focus on the results voted on when we are having a discussion&rdquo;

**What do organisers who use Audience Response Systems say?**

&ldquo;It is more interesting for the audience as they are able to see how the votes go.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Rather than just talking, the polling results are the evidence of the discussion and group opinion.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Results of the votes are useful information for tracking and analysis after the event.&ldquo; &ldquo;I saved days of effort in compiling the evaluation forms. I was able to provide it to the client as soon as the event ended and it was all done. Fantastic!&rdquo;

[ ![Simultaneous Interpretation Interpreters](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/5.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/5.jpg)

Simultaneous Interpretation Interpreters are a &ldquo;Special Breed&rdquo;, they have the capacity to Listen &amp; Talk at the same time, AND doing this whilst converting from one language to another.

Simultaneous Interpretation differs from Consecutive interpretation, which is first listening (Perhaps a few sentences of speech) and then interpreting into a 2nd language. This of course takes twice as long as a Simultaneous Interpretation and removes the spontaneity of conversation that can be captured with Simultaneous Interpretation.

Simultaneous Translation and Simtran are often used to mean Simultaneous Interpretation, but are terms that are not strictly correct.

**Finding an Interpreter**

[ ![Finding and Interpreter](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6.jpg)

Congress Rental can advise and guide clients on suitable interpreters and interpreter suppliers to best meet their objectives. This ensures that our clients receive quality Simultaneous Interpretation based on location, language requirements and budget.

When clients look to source Simultaneous Interpretation interpreters, they should always ensure that they are suitably qualified. Ensure that you have references relating to similar events, so you can be sure that your event is a success.

**Equipment Designed for Interpreters**

[ ![Equipment Designed for Interpreters](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/7.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/7.jpg)

The Bosch Equipment was designed in conjunction with Interpreters and Interpreter Professional Organisations (AIIC). The Interpreters always have their own Interpreter desk (console) and have complete control of their input and output languages, as well as volume, bass and treble. All Interpreter desks have relay facilities.

**Our Technicians work to support Interpreters**

Our technicians look after the interests of the interpreters to ensure that all their needs are met. This includes ensuring the equipment is set up in order to meet the individual interpreter’s personal preferences, locating the booths with line-of-site to the presenter and the visual presentation material, and ensuring that water and glasses are provided to the interpreters.

Prior to each event, our technicians will test the equipment with the Interpreters in situ, and undertake an end to end test of the equipment and the system. This gives the interpreters comfort that everything is tested and working and the technician comfort that the interpreters are familiar with the setup and equipment.

Never has a wireless conference microphone discussion system been so easy to use, yet so powerful. For a simple set-up the system is almost ready to use right out of the box. But for more demanding situations, the range of functionality and additional options are impressive.

**Congress Control Software, intuitive and user-friendly**

[ ![Congress Rental Network](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/17-300x225.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/17.png)

The congress control software allows an operator a great degree of control over the system. Delegate names can be easily assigned to all wireless discussion units before a meeting. The operator has control over the microphones during the meeting; he can start or stop voting sessions and display and log the voting results.During the conference, an operator can also monitor the battery status of every individual wireless discussion unit, and check whether or not all the units are receiving the signal properly. The software is optimized for touch screens and features a multi-lingual graphical user interface (GUI).

**Absolutely safe**

All signals within the DCN Wireless System are digitally protected against tapping or eavesdropping. The intelligent system even features automatic subscription blocking. Further subscriptions are prevented, even if the operator forgets to close the subscription process.

A standard Conference Microphone set-up can be enhanced with the use of Software Control and Microphone Management Software, allowing the chairman or our technician to control the microphones in the room. There are many ways in which the Software control of microphones enhances the meeting:

The Software can tell you who requested to speak first.

With large numbers of delegates, its easy to locate the person speaking

The correct meeting protocol is easy to implement.

The chairman knows immediately who is in the queue ready to speak.

A delegate microphone accidentally left on can be remotely switched off.

Managing the time allocated to delegates is easy.

**How it works!**

[ ![mics, dome software ctrl cropped](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mics-dome-sftware-ctrl-cropped- 300x233.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mics- dome-sftware-ctrl-cropped.jpg)

Software queuing is an additional feature that can be added to our microphone systems.

The chairman is provided a screen that shows a layout of the room showing the microphones and also a list of the delegates wishing to speak.

The technician at the back of the room has control of the system. The laptop screen is replicated for the chairman, so the chairman has full visibility on proceedings. The chairman then directs the meeting as they wish and the technician operates according to these directions.

[ ![Screen only](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09 /Screen-only-300x218.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-only.jpg)

The technician can also turn off un-used microphones.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> I was pleased with the professional services and responsiveness from Congress Rental. Their producer, Joan, guided us on how we could use the system right from the preparation stage. On both days of the event, they arrived ahead of schedule and set-up and integrated their audience response system seamlessly with our appointed AV vendor. The event went smoothly and I would recommend them to anyone who is planning to use audience response system for an event.

Congress Rental provides audience response systems from CLiKAPAD to cater for standard voting requirements. This system is ideal for clients looking for a budget solution.

The entire audience response system consists of light-weight, credit card sized keypads with Radio Frequency transmission (2.4GHz WIFI band) compact base station connected via USB port. The whole system can be easily transported from meeting to meeting as it packs neatly into its own carry case.

This is especially useful for international events where the system can be hand-carried by the producer to the conference, without the hassle of having to organise logistics with freight forwarding companies.

A PowerPoint plug-in ensures that the results are instantly displayed as an integral part of PowerPoint.

Choose from a selection of question and graph styles that include, a countdown timer with music to limit the time the audience have to respond to the vote. The results can be shown immediately, or where sensitive, held back to be viewed after the event and can be represented as a percentage of total votes or as actual votes cast.

The voting results can be delivered to match a corporate colour scheme and text style and presented on event Power Point templates.

At the end of the event, the results are available in PowerPoint format and standard Excel results are provided for further analysis at the client’s leisure.

**Keypads**

**Special Application**

**Attendant Call System**

This audience response system can be configured as an Attendant Call System, such as those used by Heads of States or VIPs to privately call their support staff without leaving their seat.

Due to its small credit card size and light weight, the wireless keypad is subtle and unobtrusive.

**How does it work?**

The VIP sends an alert back to a base-station by pressing any key on the device. This in turn triggers an alert to a laptop that controls the system.

The laptop displays the ID number of the keypad, thereby indicating which VIP requires assistance.

**Specific Solution**

Congress Rental provided such a system for APEC Ministers Meeting Sydney.

In this case the client wanted a single button as an attendant call button.

[ ![NewZealand](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/53-300x179.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/53.jpg)

This photo shows the attendant call unit used by the New Zealand Prime Minister. Each keypad was specifically customized to suit the event, where each Leader had a personalised unit.

Congress Rental is able to customize the keypads to any layout, applying different numbers to different actions or requirements. The cost for additional service depends upon the actual requirements.

**Notes:**

Congress Rental Network provided Conference Microphones and Simultaneous Interpretation for APEC Leaders in Singapore.

Originally planning to provide equipment for ASEAN-US Dialogue conference with leaders from ASEAN along with US President Obama with 12 Microphones, 4 booths for languages ( Lao, Myanmar, Vietnam, Korea) and 80 Digital Infra-red receivers for senior government support staff. It came as quite a shock when 24 hours before the day of the event the requirement for 5 additional booths were required. Azhar Zainal, the operations manager of Congress Rental in Singapore said, &ldquo;we are used to these very tight time frames for making decisions (24 hours notice), but the security to get the booths out of one venue and into the Shangri-la where the event was held was amazing, I have never seen anything like it.&rdquo;

The event from a technical perspective went off seamlessly and everybody was happy.

We, along with the Mexican Interpreter also got a personal wave from President Obama.

Fantastic Location!

Logistically difficult, since all the equipment was taken up by Gondola from the Base of the Mountain, up to Skyline complex.

One of our table top booths was perfect for the job, since it fitted on the Gondola and the event ran for a short time.

[ ![integrus](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/integrus_pic.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/integrus_pic.jpg)

**Perfect reception**

The most remarkable aspect of the Integrus is its complete immunity to interference from lighting systems. By using a higher frequency band (2 to 8 MHz) it operates way beyond the reach of all types of hall lighting. This gives it a significant advantage over analog systems, which are often affected by the increasing use of high-frequency lighting systems, especially those with dimmers. Integrus offers you perfect reception, every time.

**Hearing is believing**

As for the digital sound quality itself, it has to be heard to be believed. A much higher signal/noise ratio of more than 80 dB, plus inbuilt error correction, gives a crystal clear signal at every point in the venue. Using standard quality mode - which is more than adequate for interpretations - 32 channels can be distributed simultaneously. You can also choose 16 premium quality mono channels, or 8 channels of premium quality stereo transmission

**Easy channel selection**

Any one of up to 32 different channels (31 interpretations + 1 floor) can be selected by simply scrolling though the menu. Unused channels are automatically removed, which makes it easier to find the desired language.

**Language distribution …and more**

Integrus is ideal for congress centers, universities, international organizations, or indeed any venue where simultaneous interpretations take place. But it can also provide perfect quality, wireless multi-track audio in other situations, for instance multi-lingual soundtracks (cinemas),music (sports clubs &amp; factories).

[ ![Simultaneous Interpretation Interpreters](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/5.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/5.jpg)

Simultaneous Interpretation Interpreters are a &ldquo;Special Breed&rdquo;, they have the capacity to Listen &amp; Talk at the same time, AND doing this whilst converting from one language to another.

Simultaneous Interpretation differs from Consecutive interpretation, which is first listening (Perhaps a few sentences of speech) and then interpreting into a 2nd language. This of course takes twice as long as a Simultaneous Interpretation and removes the spontaneity of conversation that can be captured with Simultaneous Interpretation.

Simultaneous Translation and Simtran are often used to mean Simultaneous Interpretation, but are terms that are not strictly correct.

**Finding an Interpreter**

[ ![Finding and Interpreter](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6.jpg)

Congress Rental can advise and guide clients on suitable interpreters and interpreter suppliers to best meet their objectives. This ensures that our clients receive quality Simultaneous Interpretation based on location, language requirements and budget.

When clients look to source Simultaneous Interpretation interpreters, they should always ensure that they are suitably qualified. Ensure that you have references relating to similar events, so you can be sure that your event is a success.

**Equipment Designed for Interpreters**

[ ![Equipment Designed for Interpreters](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/7.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/7.jpg)

The Bosch Equipment was designed in conjunction with Interpreters and Interpreter Professional Organisations (AIIC). The Interpreters always have their own Interpreter desk (console) and have complete control of their input and output languages, as well as volume, bass and treble. All Interpreter desks have relay facilities.

**Our Technicians work to support Interpreters**

Our technicians look after the interests of the interpreters to ensure that all their needs are met. This includes ensuring the equipment is set up in order to meet the individual interpreter’s personal preferences, locating the booths with line-of-site to the presenter and the visual presentation material, and ensuring that water and glasses are provided to the interpreters.

Prior to each event, our technicians will test the equipment with the Interpreters in situ, and undertake an end to end test of the equipment and the system. This gives the interpreters comfort that everything is tested and working and the technician comfort that the interpreters are familiar with the setup and equipment.

**THE CLIENT**

The Pistorio Foundation is a non-profit organization based in Geneva, Switzerland, founded by Pasquale Pistorio in April 2005. It works to provide assistance to under privileged children in the field of health, nutrition, and education, by sponsoring children’s education and health and by building and improving school infrastructures. The Pistorio Foundation also supports programs for village community development.

The Pistorio Foundation has projects in five countries: Burkina Faso, Tibet (China), Thailand, Cambodia and Morocco.

**THE CHALLENGE**

![Pistorio Foundation](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case_Pistorio_3.jpg)

The Pistorio Foundation Singapore Chapter held its third annual Gala Dinner on November 30th, 2010, at the Shangri-La Hotel Tower Ballroom. The &ldquo;Dolce Vita&rdquo; themed event was realised in partnership with the Italian Trade Commission and supported by the Italian Cultural Institute. The Organising Committee wanted to leverage the Silent Auction technology to reach their goals of raising funds at this event to support 360 under-privileged hill-tribe children in Chiang Rai, Thailand during the silent auction segment of their fund raising event.

**ACTIONS**

Pistorio Foundation expected about 200 guests for this event and engaged Congress Rental to provide them with the solution for the Silent Auction and Pledging segment.

Elena Pistorio, Chairman of the Organising Committee, was not sure what to expect as it was the first time they are using this fundraising technology. To give them the assurance, a producer was assigned to handle this project from the preparation stage through to the execution as a single point of contact.

As the Organising Committee had not seen pledging done previously, they were not sure if they wanted to proceed with it. To give them a better idea, Congress Rental went ahead to prepare the draft for the pledging screen for each project to show them how it would look during the presentation. After much consideration, the committee decided to give it a try as the funds were required urgently to benefit the children.

The Pistorio Foundation decided to utilize the Pledge feature to get their guests to contribute to 3 main projects, namely a long-term scholarship, a library and a computer room for a primary school in Huay Kuk, Chiang Rai.

**RESULTS**

![Pistorio Foundation](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case_Pistorio_4.jpg)

![Pistorio Foundation](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/case_Pistorio_5.jpg)

Pistorio Foundation was absolutely delighted with the outcome as they reached their target for the silent auction and pledging segment for the event.

The result from the pledge was heartening as 2 of the projects exceeded the target. This was an unexpected win as this is the first time pledging was introduced for as part of their event. Pistorio Foundation was able to provide 2 children with long-term scholarship instead of 1 as initially planned.

The check-out was well managed as the summary reports were provided to the volunteers tending to the different payment modes upon closure of the auction. At the same time the guests were making the payment, invoices were provided to them, saving both time and efforts in verification of details and mailing.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> Congress Rental was attentive to our guests’ needs and was able to provide our VIPs with their individualized smart cards at short notice when they requested to join in the excitement during the bidding.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Our guests reflected that it was great way to do a silent auction, as there is no need to leave their seats to bid!&rdquo;

&ldquo;I was very pleased with the professional service, from the pre-sales consultation, preparation through to the execution.

I am confident that I can keep the silent auction going on for longer to raise more funds, for our next event.&ldquo;_

**THE CLIENT**

Special Olympics is an international non-profit organisation that changes lives by encouraging and empowering people with intellectual disabilities, promoting acceptance for all, and fostering community understanding and respect worldwide through sports training and athletic competition. Funding comes from a variety or sources including special events, corporate partnerships, government support, and private donors.

**THE CHALLENGE**

In October 2010, The American Chamber of Commerce sponsored a Gala Dinner in support of Special Olympics. The dinner, which aimed to raise funds for a variety of programs, was the first time Special Olympics opted to use **silent auction technology.** Unfamiliar with bidding technology, Special Olympics staff were unsure if the guests would be receptive to using the devices.

**ACTIONS**

Special Olympics engaged Congress Rental to provide their 200 guests with the silent auction technology through the use of keypads and smart cards for each guest to track bidding details.

As part of their full-service approach, Congress Rental assigned a producer to handle the project from end-to-end.

From the preparation stage, where the silent auction summary screens were prepared, to the loading of lot items and guests list right through to the execution during the gala dinner. To give Special Olympics the assurance that the outcome would be as expected, samples and drafts of the silent auction summary screen and invoices were prepared for review by the committee before being finalized.

Jeremy Ducklin, the Managing Director of Congress Rental, was personally present at the event to lend his expertise, to all aspects of the silent auction. This gave additional confidence to the committee on the quality delivery of the technology.

**RESULTS**

During the event, the lot items and bids were broadcast on giant screens throughout the ballroom. From the comfort of their dinner table, guests could see how their bids stacked up against the competition. There was great buzz as guests tried to outbid one another for the most sought after items. For example, actress Zhang Ziyi’s Personal Constellation Style Omega Wristwatch with a starting bid of $1,000 went for eight times that!

Special Olympics staff was delighted by the atmosphere created and the funds raised which far exceeded their expectations. They were able to benefit from the use of silent auction technology as the results and invoices were instantly available at the close of the silent auction. There was no need for a last minute rush from the volunteers to manually tabulate the bid sheets and create invoices.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

	> We are so pleased with the services provided by Congress Rental that we plan to include this segment in our future fundraisers, not only in Singapore but also around the region.

Mr. David Rutherford, Regional President &amp; Managing Director of Special Olympics Asia Pacific

	> Our guests were so enthusiastic that they were at the check-out counter before we were ready! I was glad that the reports and invoices were available so soon after the silent auction was closed.

Silent PA is where we use the multichannel distribution functionality of the Bosch Simultaneous Interpretation system to provide a solution for Exhibitions, Gyms and teaching environments where a dedicated audio channel is required for some people, but not for everyone.

**The Problem**

The Problem at Exhibitions is that there a large number of audio sources all competing for the attention of the attendee. This makes it very difficult for an exhibitor to convey a message requiring either a focus of attention or privacy.

**The Solution**

The solution is Silent PA. Each delegate is provided a receiver and headset. The delegate then chooses the channel that corresponds to the audio channel of interest. This can be a single channel or multiple channels up to 32. This allows delegates to go to multiple booths and listen to the sound track or presenter associated with that booth without audio interference from adjacent booths.

**Training Sessions**

[ ![Training Sessions](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_6024-300x194.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_6024.jpg)

Where multiple training sessions are to be conducted in a common area, the Silent PA system provides the perfect solution. In the picture shown there were 5 presenters each with different presentations. The trainee’s used the computers to enhance the training and could follow any one of the 5 topics being presented by simply selecting the appropriate channel on the Receiver.

**Gyms**

[ ![Gyms](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC01599-300x199.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC01599.jpg)

Gym users are keen to be entertained with a variety of video and audio sources whilst they are at the gym. The infrared system allows each fitness fanatic to select the audio channel they prefer without the need for disturbing their neighbour. These can be audio channels corresponding to a radio station, video or TV.

A standard Conference Microphone set-up can be enhanced with the use of Software Control and Microphone Management Software, allowing the chairman or our technician to control the microphones in the room. There are many ways in which the Software control of microphones enhances the meeting:

The Software can tell you who requested to speak first.

With large numbers of delegates, its easy to locate the person speaking

The correct meeting protocol is easy to implement.

The chairman knows immediately who is in the queue ready to speak.

A delegate microphone accidentally left on can be remotely switched off.

Managing the time allocated to delegates is easy.

**How it works!**

The chairman is provided a screen that shows a layout of the room showing the microphones and also a list of the delegates wishing to speak.

The technician at the back of the room has control of the system. The laptop screen is replicated for the chairman, so the chairman has full visibility on proceedings. The chairman then directs the meeting as they wish and the technician operates according to these directions.

A standard Conference Microphone set-up can be enhanced with the use of Software Control and Microphone Management Software, allowing the chairman or our technician to control the microphones in the room. There are many ways in which the Software control of microphones enhances the meeting:

The Software can tell you who requested to speak first.

With large numbers of delegates, its easy to locate the person speaking

The correct meeting protocol is easy to implement.

The chairman knows immediately who is in the queue ready to speak.

A delegate microphone accidentally left on can be remotely switched off.

Managing the time allocated to delegates is easy.

Attain buy-in through the use of the audiences &ldquo;own&rdquo; data

  * Every member of your audience is given a voting handset.   * Questions are displayed to the audience   * Participants select their answer   * The vote is closed and the results are instantly displayed

At Congress Rental, we provide wireless audience response systems that transmit data from the keypads to the base station via Radio Frequency (2.4 GHz WIFI). This ensures that we can cater to both small and large groups on a single base station. The data travels via Radio Frequency, therefore participants merely need to be within range of the base station, and need not maintain line-of-sight between keypads and the receiver.

A producer will be on-site to operate the chosen audience response solution.

At the end of the event, detailed voting results will be provided for client to perform further analysis.

**What do delegates using Audience Response Systems say?**

&ldquo;When I was given the handset, I felt that my opinion was being valued.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It feels powerful as I am able to influence and help shape the outcomes of the conference.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It helps us, the participants, to focus on the results voted on when we are having a discussion&rdquo;

**What do organisers who use Audience Response Systems say?**

&ldquo;It is more interesting for the audience as they are able to see how the votes go.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Rather than just talking, the polling results are the evidence of the discussion and group opinion.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Results of the votes are useful information for tracking and analysis after the event.&ldquo; &ldquo;I saved days of effort in compiling the evaluation forms. I was able to provide it to the client as soon as the event ended and it was all done. Fantastic!&rdquo;

**Quick set-up**

Designed to be the most flexible discussion system available, the Bosch DCN Wireless Conference Microphone Discussion System offers the perfect solution for challenging locations such as multiuser venues and historical buildings. For multi-use venues, the wireless system allows owners to service customers better, easily and more effectively. With minimal time required for set-up or break-down, multiple events can take place in sequence, meaning better and more effective use of space.

**No impact on location**

For historical locations, the benefits can be even more pronounced. A discussion system can be installed, rearranged and operated with virtually no impact on the integrity of the historical location. One no longer has to worry about damaging antique materials or ruining the aesthetics of a grand hall. No cables have to be laid or holes drilled. The entire system has been designed to be beautiful and unobtrusive so that all participants can focus on the event at hand.

**The WAP**

With the User in Mind

**Easily adaptable**

[ ![Congress Rental Network](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/15-300x199.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/15.jpg)

The DCN Wireless Conference Microphone Discussion System has been intelligently designed to be as user friendly as possible, whether the user is a system operator, chairman or participant. Discussion units are comfortable and intuitive to use. The system is built with high end finishing materials, giving it a timeless and discrete look. The design includes changeable rims (charcoal black, mat or glossy metal and silver), meaning that you can modify each discussion unit to better fit with its environment.

** Single access point **

[ ![Congress Rental Network](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/4-300x198.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/4.png)

The award-winning Wireless Access Point (WAP) provides a consistently strong connection for a range of approximately 30m (100ft). The WAP can be positioned centrally for optimal coverage or easily moved to the most convenient and discreet location in the room.

**Feeling secure**

The system is protected against interference from mobile phones and other equipment making use of WiFi, Blue-Tooth or microwave signals. A proprietary protocol protects against 3 rd party eaves dropping.

**No interruptions **

Battery functionality has been designed with simplicity and effectiveness in mind. The system features high capacity and easily removable chargeable battery packs, as well as a dynamic overview of battery consumption. To conserve power consumption during longer breaks, each unit is capable of a patent-pending &ldquo;sleep mode&rdquo;. Conferences need never again be interrupted because of low battery power.

**Simple Standalone or Control Software**

**Simple, yet scalable**

[ ![Congress Rental Network](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/16-300x225.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/16.jpg)

Never has a wireless conference microphone discussion system been so easy to use, yet so powerful. For a simple set-up the system is almost ready to use right out of the box. But for more demanding situations, the range of functionality and additional options are impressive.

**Congress Control Software, intuitive and user-friendly**

[ ![Congress Rental Network](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/17-300x225.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/17.png)

The congress control software allows an operator a great degree of control over the system. Delegate names can be easily assigned to all wireless discussion units before a meeting. The operator has control over the microphones during the meeting; he can start or stop voting sessions and display and log the voting results.During the conference, an operator can also monitor the battery status of every individual wireless discussion unit, and check whether or not all the units are receiving the signal properly. The software is optimized for touch screens and features a multi-lingual graphical user interface (GUI).

**Absolutely safe**
