Congress Rental provides audience response systems from CLiKAPAD to cater for standard voting requirements. This system is ideal for clients looking for a budget solution.

The entire audience response system consists of light-weight, credit card sized keypads with Radio Frequency transmission (2.4GHz WIFI band) compact base station connected via USB port. The whole system can be easily transported from meeting to meeting as it packs neatly into its own carry case.

This is especially useful for international events where the system can be hand-carried by the producer to the conference, without the hassle of having to organise logistics with freight forwarding companies.

A PowerPoint plug-in ensures that the results are instantly displayed as an integral part of PowerPoint.

Choose from a selection of question and graph styles that include, a countdown timer with music to limit the time the audience have to respond to the vote. The results can be shown immediately, or where sensitive, held back to be viewed after the event and can be represented as a percentage of total votes or as actual votes cast.

The voting results can be delivered to match a corporate colour scheme and text style and presented on event Power Point templates.

At the end of the event, the results are available in PowerPoint format and standard Excel results are provided for further analysis at the client’s leisure.

**Special Application**

**Attendant Call System**

This audience response system can be configured as an Attendant Call System, such as those used by Heads of States or VIPs to privately call their support staff without leaving their seat.

Due to its small credit card size and light weight, the wireless keypad is subtle and unobtrusive.

**How does it work?**

The VIP sends an alert back to a base-station by pressing any key on the device. This in turn triggers an alert to a laptop that controls the system.

The laptop displays the ID number of the keypad, thereby indicating which VIP requires assistance.

**Specific Solution**

Congress Rental provided such a system for APEC Ministers Meeting Sydney.

In this case the client wanted a single button as an attendant call button.

This photo shows the attendant call unit used by the New Zealand Prime Minister. Each keypad was specifically customized to suit the event, where each Leader had a personalised unit.

Congress Rental is able to customize the keypads to any layout, applying different numbers to different actions or requirements. The cost for additional service depends upon the actual requirements.
