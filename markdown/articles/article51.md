Audience participation is an incredibly important aspect of any successful event. However this can become tricky to manage and encourage when an audience grows past a certain size, this is where an audience response system comes in very useful.

OCBC Bank is one of Asia’s leading financial services groups and one of the largest financial institutions in the combined Singapore-Malaysia market. OCBC Bank is among the world’s highest rated banks.

In January 2011, 800 customers attended an investment seminar hosted by OCBC Premier Banking covering equity, foreign exchange and property markets.

## THE CHALLENGE

The client contacted Congress Rental in their search for professional audience response services to enable the audience to participate in live polling. To create a dialogue between the seminar speakers, the client wanted to enable live polling so that they can also gauge customer sentiments on equity, currency and property markets.

The client was hosting two seminars, one in Mandarin and one in English, which meant that **bilingual voting slides** were required for the Mandarin seminar. The organisers wanted flexibility to make amendments to the polling questions, catering for **last minute changes from the speakers** up to the point of the rehearsal.

## ACTIONS

Congress Rental provided 480 and 320 Communicators respectively, for each run of the seminars conducted in English and Chinese, during which OCBC Premier Banking customers were polled on their views on market sentiments.

From the pre-sales stage, a producer was assigned to this project to provide seamless support throughout. Upon understanding the client’s requirements, the committee members were given a run-through of the proposed polling slides, presentation of the results and the countdown timer music. Further amendments requested for by the team were drafted, simulated within the Congress Rental system and then transmitted for review by the client. This gave the client the assurance and confidence that the outcome would match expectations.

## RESULTS

The setup and the testing of the system went smoothly within the short timeframe. The producer was on hand to assist the Master of Ceremony and the speakers to familiarize the technology. Even though there were last minute changes and clarification from the organizing committee, these were easily incorporated into the audience response system.

The interactivity provided by the Communicator handsets meant that attendees were engaged throughout the various topics while encouraging active participation. The voting process was easy to administer and the participants were able to use the devices with ease. There was a lively atmosphere, as the Premier Banking customers were able to give their valued views on market sentiments for equity, foreign exchange and property markets. The speakers were impressed by the proficient insight given by the clientele.

## VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT

	> I was pleased with the professional services and responsiveness from Congress Rental. Their producer, Joan, guided us on how we could use the system right from the preparation stage. On both days of the event, they arrived ahead of schedule and set-up and integrated their audience response system seamlessly with our appointed AV vendor. The event went smoothly and I would recommend them to anyone who is planning to use audience response system for an event.
