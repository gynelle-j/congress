**Perfect reception**

The most remarkable aspect of the Integrus is its complete immunity to interference from lighting systems. By using a higher frequency band (2 to 8 MHz) it operates way beyond the reach of all types of hall lighting. This gives it a significant advantage over analog systems, which are often affected by the increasing use of high-frequency lighting systems, especially those with dimmers. Integrus offers you perfect reception, every time.

**Hearing is believing**

As for the digital sound quality itself, it has to be heard to be believed. A much higher signal/noise ratio of more than 80 dB, plus inbuilt error correction, gives a crystal clear signal at every point in the venue. Using standard quality mode - which is more than adequate for interpretations - 32 channels can be distributed simultaneously. You can also choose 16 premium quality mono channels, or 8 channels of premium quality stereo transmission

**Easy channel selection**

Any one of up to 32 different channels (31 interpretations + 1 floor) can be selected by simply scrolling though the menu. Unused channels are automatically removed, which makes it easier to find the desired language.

**Language distribution â€¦and more**

Integrus is ideal for congress centers, universities, international organizations, or indeed any venue where simultaneous interpretations take place. But it can also provide perfect quality, wireless multi-track audio in other situations, for instance multi-lingual soundtracks (cinemas),music (sports clubs &amp; factories).
