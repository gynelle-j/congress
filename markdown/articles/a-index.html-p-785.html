**Notes:**

The sheer scale of this event was the most challenging. The 64 radiators in
the Entertainment centre required

4 separate visits to plan in detail the location of the radiators in order to
get the coverage

required for 12 Languages across 11,000 seats.

During the President of Lions speech, the Sydney Entertainment centre was
packed with Lions’ Delegates. Providing Infra-red coverage for the entire area
was the most challenging part of the event and its success was very rewarding
and a great achievement
