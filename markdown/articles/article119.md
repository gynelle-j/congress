## Location:

## Brisbane Convention Centre (BCEC)

## Features:

4 Automated Video Domes

60 Conference Microphones

Software Control

## Date:

## July 2009

## Notes:

Microphones integrated with Dome Camera system allows the dome cameras to automatically display the person speaking on the microphone.

Set-up on this job required the most effort, but once set, the system ran itself.

The video output from the domes was sent to screens in the room and was available for output to secondary viewing rooms.
