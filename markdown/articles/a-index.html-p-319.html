A Tour guide or Whisper System allows a tour leader or Interpreter to
communicate with multiple members of their party at the same time. Our systems
consists of a Transmitter with a head worn microphone and 20 Receivers each
with a single earpiece. This is a simple system to operate and use. In most
cases we provide the system without a technician and users set it up and
operate it by following the simple operations guide that we provide.

Why Assistive Listening? Whether in a theatre, church, cathedral, Mosque,
synagogue, a sporting event or factory tour people want to experience every
word and they deserve to hear every sound. Although most people can suffice
with a standard sound system, there are inevitably several in every gathering
who could use a little help, or who want an enhanced hearing experience. Our
assistive listening devices are designed to provide an easy and convenient
wireless sound solution.
