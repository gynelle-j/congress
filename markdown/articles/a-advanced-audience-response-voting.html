This reliable and unique state of the art technology audience response system
offers presenters, auctioneers, organisers and hosts of any event or
conference the ability to interact with their audience easily. Whether it is
an electronic voting system in a conference or a silent auction taking place
at a fundraising event, audience participation is essential and this is where
an audience response system can make a big difference.

In addition, conference sessions can benefit from this electronic response
system, for example, by letting audience members use their voting device as a
hand held microphone to talk to the presenter and their fellow audience
members, or text responses to a moderator who can then ask questions of the
panel.

**VIEWS FROM OUR CLIENT**

_“I was pleased with the professional services and responsiveness from
Congress Rental. Their producer, Joan, guided us on how we could use the
system right from the preparation stage. On both days of the event, they
arrived ahead of schedule and set-up and integrated their audience response
system seamlessly with our appointed AV vendor. The event went smoothly and I
would recommend them to anyone who is planning to use audience response system
for an event.”_

Andrea Han – Assistant Vice President, Marketing Services, OCBC
