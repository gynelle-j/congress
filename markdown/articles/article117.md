## Location:

## Sheraton Hotel - Singapore

## Features:

30 Communicators

250 Pre-programmed Smart Cards

## Date:

## August 2009

## Notes:

Silent Auctions enable electronic bidding for items, thereby massively increasing the number of bids and therefore the income for Silent auction organisers.

Lots, their value and Photo are pre-programmed into the system. Smart cards are pre-programmed with the attendeeâ€™s name.

This was the first ever use of our technology in Singapore for a Silent Auction event and it was a great success raising over SGD $35,000.
