###SILENT PA

 





Silent PA is where we use the multichannel distribution functionality of the Bosch Simultaneous Interpretation system to provide a solution for Exhibitions, Gyms and teaching environments where a dedicated audio channel is required for some people, but not for everyone.








The Problem


The Problem at Exhibitions is that there a large number of audio sources all competing for the attention of the attendee. This makes it very difficult for an exhibitor to convey a message requiring either a focus of attention or privacy.







The Solution


The solution is Silent PA. Each delegate is provided a receiver and headset. The delegate then chooses the channel that corresponds to the audio channel of interest. This can be a single channel or multiple channels up to 32. This allows delegates to go to multiple booths and listen to the sound track or presenter associated with that booth without audio interference from adjacent booths.







Training Sessions







Where multiple training sessions are to be conducted in a common area, the Silent PA system provides the perfect solution. In the picture shown there were 5 presenters each with different presentations. The trainee’s used the computers to enhance the training and could follow any one of the 5 topics being presented by simply selecting the appropriate channel on the Receiver.










Gyms







Gym users are keen to be entertained with a variety of video and audio sources whilst they are at the gym. The infrared system allows each fitness fanatic to select the audio channel they prefer without the need for disturbing their neighbour. These can be audio channels corresponding to a radio station, video or TV.
