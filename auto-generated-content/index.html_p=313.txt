###Conference Microphones

 





As used at APEC in Sydney

Our Conference Microphones, sometimes called Push to Talk Microphones are quite different to Standard Table microphones. Each includes an on/off button and a built in loudspeaker and these Conference Microphones solve the problems of noise and feedback that exist with conventional microphones.

Our Conference Microphones have a chairman override function. The chairman can press their override button which temporarily mutes all other microphones.

These Conference microphones are used for any interactive discussion, in a boardroom application or a much larger conference with 200+ people all wanting to make a contribution. They have been used for Trade Negotiations, Union Meetings, International Treaty Negotiations, Training Meetings, the applications are endless, and in fact anywhere where everyone has the possibility to be heard.

Summary


These Microphones are often known as Table Microphones or Push-to-talk microphones. This really just means that the delegate selects when they wish to speak. Also known as Digimics® they all perform in a similar manner.

Our Conference Microphones are an ideal replacement for table microphones that don’t have a push to talk button. Standard Table microphones require the operator to turn on the delegate / panelist. Our conference microphones are turned on by the presenter; this also eliminates the possibility of any embarrasing asides being heard by the audience.

Conference Microphones are ideally suited to work with simultaneous interpretation systems. These Conference Microphones are also ideal in either Plenary or breakout areas.

The Conference Microphones come as either Wired or Wireless Conference Microphones. We use only Bosch equipment, for their high quality audio microphones and features which include Push to Talk Microphones also known at PTT Microphones and also Voice Activated Microphones.

Around the world, what we call Conference Microphones are referred to as Serial Microphones, as table microphones and as digimics ®

These Wireless &amp; Wired Conference Microphones, Push to Talk Microphones, Serial Microphones and Table Microphones have a multitude of applications. Including, High Level Government meetings, association meetings, Conference room installations, board room installations, in fact any meeting where there is interactivity.

These Conference microphones are also ideal for integrating with your Video Conferencing system and also Teleconferencing, especially where there are difficult acoustics in the room.
